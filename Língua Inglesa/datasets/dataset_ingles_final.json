They are\nassumed to be socioeconomic and political problems, such as avoiding war, building the economy, curbing terrorism, fighting\npoverty and disease, or preserving a healthful environment. We can predict, however, that it will become clear that all social-\neconomic-political issues intersect and that issues of technological advance are right in the middle of every intersection,\nsometimes causing the problems, more often offering possibilities for their solutions, and frequently providing opportunities for\nthe world society to rise to new, higher levels of productivity, satisfaction, and happiness.\nOf course, trying to predict the future with perfection is not defensible. But if we are active in some field, we are bound to be\naware of important trends in it, and we should take our anticipations of significant future events seriously. We should force\nourselves to list potential developments regularly, estimating for each the probability of its occurrence and the importance of the\nevent should it occur. Then, for those happenings we consider both highly probable and significant, we should ask ourselves what\nwe can do early to enhance the positive and suppress the negative consequences.\nAt present we see that the impact of advancing technology on the social-economic-political framework of the entire globe is\ngrowing rapidly, yet its implications are far from being adequately explored. Moreover, the effects of technological change are\nunderestimated as short-range; crisis-dominated problems monopolize the attention of most of the world’s leaders.

But for years, the\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) has gotten complaints that people felt drowsy the morning after taking the medicine or its\nsuccessors, and sometimes got into car accidents.\nAfter laboratory studies and driving tests confirming the risks of drowsiness, the FDA said that women should be taking half as\nmuch of the medicine. The new recommendation applies to drugs containing the active ingredient zolpidem, by far the most\nwidely used sleep aid. Using lower doses means less of the drug will remain in the blood in the morning hours, and will reduce the\nrisk that people who use it will be impaired while driving.\nThe announcement was focused on women because they take longer to metabolize the drug than men. An estimated 10 percent\nto 15 percent of women will have a level of zolpidem in their blood that could impair driving eight hours after taking the pill, while\nonly about 3 percent of men do. Reports of aftereffects from sleeping pills have circulated for years, and some doctors questioned\nwhy the drug agency took so long to act. Mishaps with sleepy driving — and even strange acts of texting, eating or having sex in\nthe night without any memory of it in the morning — have long been familiar to the medical community.\nInternet: <www.nytimes.com> (adapted).\nJudge the item according to the text above.",

(...) They would sing, as a chorus,\nto words which to many would seem unmeaning jargon, but which, nevertheless, were full of meaning to themselves. I have\nsometimes thought that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of\nslavery, than the reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject could do.\nI did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the\ncircle; so that I neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a tale of woe which was then altogether\nbeyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling\nover with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains. The\nhearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequently found myself in\ntears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs, even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an\nexpression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the\ndehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of\nslavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of\nslavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, and, on allowance-day, place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him,\nin silence, analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul, and if he is not thus impressed, it will only be\nbecause “there is no flesh in his obdurate heart.”\nFrederick Douglass.

As somebody has put it, “When the same incumbent firm has been in place for 100 years,\nto me that’s not an audit, that’s a joint venture.”\nMost academic studies have either found no link between the length of a relationship and its quality, or determined that longer\ntenures yield better results, because the accountants have time to master the intricacies of clients’ businesses. Obliging\ncompanies to solicit bids at regular intervals, as Britain does, has shaken up the business: HSBC said in August that it will drop\nKPMG in favour of PwC; on December 2nd Unilever announced that it is making the opposite switch. Indeed, the big accounting\nfirms argue that forced rotation would reduce competition by preventing the incumbent from bidding.\nProponents counter that the accounting giants, and academics whose research is often financed by them, have good reason to\nresist change. Among the reform’s strongest supporters are smaller firms that hope to break the Big Four’s stranglehold.\nYet even the most vocal advocates of mandatory rotation concede that it is no magic bullet.

The relevance of this tool is growing because organisations of all kinds now\nrecognise the importance of environmental matters and accept that their environmental performance will be scrutinised by a wide\nrange of interested parties. These parties will use environmental auditing to investigate, understand and identify actions which\nhelp improve existing human activities, with the aim of reducing their adverse effects on the environment. An environmental\nauditor is the professional who will, on behalf of these parties, study an organisation’s environmental effects in a systematic and\ndocumented manner and will produce an environmental audit report based on the data provided. There are many reasons for\nundertaking an environmental audit, which include issues such as environmental legislation and pressure from customers.\nAs a matter of definition, the term “audit” has its origins in the financial sector. Auditing, in general, is a methodical examination\nof procedures and practices aimed at verifying whether they comply with legal requirements, internal policies and accepted\npractices. The expression “environmental auditing” is often used as a generic term covering a variety ofmanagement practices\nused to evaluate a company’s environmental performance. Strictly, it refers to checking systems and procedures against standards\nor regulations, as said before, but it is often used to cover the gathering and evaluation of any data with environmental relevance.\nConsidering the terminology used in the area, environmental auditing should not be confused with environmental impact\nassessment, although both are environmental management tools and the difference between them has become blurred. The\nformer is carried out when a development is already in place, and is used to check on existing practices, assessing the\nenvironmental effects of current activities. It is correct to say that it provides a “snap-shot” of looking at what is happening at that\npoint in time in an organisation. The latter is an anticipatory tool, that is, it takes place before an action is carried out. It is\ntherefore an attempt to predict the impact on the environment of a future action, and to provide this information to those who\nmake the decision on whether the project should be authorised.\nInternet: <www.soas.ac.uk> (adapted).\nBased on the text, judge the following item.",

It was the colour of an old football, and more or less the shape of\none, save for the sunken cheeks and a strand or two of coarse, dry hair, like the hair on a coconut. Orlando’s father, or perhaps\nhis grandfather, had struck it from the shoulders of a vast Pagan who had started up under the moon in the barbarian fields of\nAfrica; and now it swung, gently, perpetually, in the breeze which never ceased blowing through the attic rooms of the gigantic\nhouse of the lord who had slain him.\nOrlando’s fathers had ridden in fields of asphodel, and stony fields, and fields watered by strange rivers, and they had struck\nmany heads of many colours off many shoulders, and brought them back to hang from the rafters. So too would Orlando, he\nvowed. But since he was sixteen only, and too young to ride with them in Africa or France, he would steal away from his mother\nand the peacocks in the garden and go to his attic room and there lunge and plunge and slice the air with his blade. (…) His\nfathers had been noble since they had been at all. They came out of the northern mists wearing coronets on their heads. Were\nnot the bars of darkness in the room, and the yellow pools which chequered the floor, made by the sun falling through the stained\nglass of a vast coat of arms in the window? Orlando stood now in the midst of the yellow body of a heraldic leopard. When he put\nhis hand on the window-sill to push the window open, it was instantly coloured red, blue, and yellow like a butterfly’s wing. Thus,\nthose who like symbols, and have a turn for the deciphering of them, might observe that though the shapely legs, the handsome\nbody, and the well-set shoulders were all of them decorated with various tints of heraldic light, Orlando’s face, as he threw the\nwindow open, was lit solely by the sun itself. A more candid, sullen face it would be impossible to find. Happy the mother who\nbears, happier still the biographer who records the life of such a one! Never need she vex herself, nor he invokes the help of\nnovelist or poet. From deed to deed, from glory to glory, from office to office he must go, his scribe following after, till they reach\nwhatever seat it may be that is the height of their desire. Orlando, to look at, was cut out precisely for some such career. The red\nof the cheeks was covered with peach down; the down on the lips was only a little thicker than the down on the cheeks. The lips\nthemselves were short and slightly drawn back over teeth of an exquisite and almond whiteness. Nothing disturbed the arrowy\nnose in its short, tense flight; the hair was dark, the ears small, and fitted closely to the head. But, alas, that these catalogues of\nyouthful beauty cannot end without mentioning forehead and eyes. Alas, that people are seldom born devoid of all three; for\ndirectly we glance at Orlando standing by the window, we must admit that he had eyes like drenched violets, so large that the\nwater seemed to have brimmed in them and widened them; and a brow like the swelling of a marble dome pressed between the\ntwo blank medallions which were his temples. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, thus do we rhapsodize. Directly we glance\nat eyes and forehead, we have to admit a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good biographer to ignore.\nVirginia Woolf. Orlando – A biography, 1928 (adapted).\nIn reference to the content of the text, its vocabulary and syntactic structure, decide whether the following statement are right\n(C) or wrong (E).\nIn lines 2, 3 and 4, although with different syntactic functions, the word it refers to the same thing: “the head of an enemy which\nswung from the rafters”.\nCerto\nErrado",

The program will involve city officials, Internet\nproviders, universities, and a large retail company, which will offer computer training to residents in some cities. The program will\noffer some residents a chance to buy tablets with educational software installed for $30 each. Other communities will receive free\nhelp with SAT preparation and free technical support.\nThe program is an offshoot of the president’s ConnectED initiative, which was announced in 2013. It aimed to link 99 percent of\nthe students from kindergarten through 12th grade to high-speed Internet in classrooms and libraries over the next five years.\nIt is also part of a renewed vigor in the Obama administration’s housing agenda coming late in his final term and recently\nemboldened by a Supreme Court ruling endorsing a broad interpretation of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, a relevant feat for civil\nrights. That ruling allows for more lawsuits that could help fight housing discrimination.\nDionne Searcey. U.S. program will connect public housing residents to Web.

        "comando": "Text\nPierre Englebert’s attempt to measure all of Africa using the yardstick of a single historical factor is highly problematic. In this\nregard, Englebert’s book suffers from four tendencies, the first two of which involve a dominant mode in current writing about\nAfrica, and the third and fourth of which reflect the constraints of academic publishing, particularly in the United States of\nAmerica. Current writing about Africa is characterised, firstly, by a remarkable tendency to generalise about the entire continent,\nwhich no author specialising in Asia, for example, would dare contemplate. This usually involves the extrapolation of a single\nempirical situation to the entire continent. In Englebert’s case, this clearly relates to his experience in the eastern Congo, which is\nmade to serve as an example for all of sub-Saharan Africa. This tendency is associated, secondly, with an intensive search for a\nsingle factor that would explain the plight of Africa, a conceptual master key that can unlock the puzzle of the “African exception”.\nEnglebert’s book is a typical example of this tendency to substitute historical explanations with a philosophy of history. He is not\nconcerned with the identification of contingent factors which, through their myriad combinations and mutual (correlated) causal\nprocesses, have led to the emergence of the current complex situation on the African continent. Instead, he claims that the entire\nsituation arose from a single historical moment — that of decolonisation — and evolved by necessity from this, and that this\nhistorical moment gave birth to a structure of post-coloniality, from which African states are fundamentally incapable of liberating\nthemselves (while non-African post-colonies apparently are capable). Here, the argument becomes outright theological: The\nsovereignty accorded by outside actors represents the “original sin” of African statehood. As a consequence, and keeping in line\nwith this theological mode of thinking, post-colonial Africa can be saved only by others.\nT. Bierschenk.

In those days, the Civil and\nDiplomatic Service entrance exams took place in three stages, by the end of which hundreds of unsuccessful candidates had been\nknocked out. Only a score or so survived the final stage to be admitted to the Foreign Office.\nMy induction course lasted about a month. Then, one morning, I was taken to the West and Central Africa Department, told that I\nwould be responsible for French-speaking African countries plus Liberia. And that was that. I was now, at the tender age of\ntwenty-two, a wet-behind-the-ears but fully functioning British diplomat.\nI was put unsparingly to the test in my first month. I was summoned to the office of the Minister of State, a genial politician called\nGeorge Thompson, who was about to receive an official visitor from the Central African Republic. I was there to interpret between\nEnglish and French. The usual pleasantries of a courtesy call were easy enough to translate. But, just as I was beginning to relax,\nthe official told Thompson that one of the main exports from his country was roselle. What on earth was roselle? With panic rising\nin my gorge, something made me blurt out “jute”. To my horror, there ensued a lively conversation in which Thompson said “jute”\nand the African minister said roselle.\nAfter the meeting, I raced back to my office and looked in my dictionary. Roselle was not there. I tried out the mystery word on a\nFrench friend, but he had not heard of it either. But the next day, he called back. What was a British minister doing, he asked,\ntalking to a politician from the Central African Republic about a plant that was used as a diuretic and food-colouring agent? My\nheart sank. I saw my career slipping beneath the waves before it had hardly begun. “Oh, and by the way,” he added, “it’s also\nused sometimes as a substitute for jute fibre — if that’s of any interest to you.”.\nChristopher Meyer.

        "comando": "Text\nAs Hegel observed of the emerging democracies of the nineteenth century, in the universe of modern political subjects “what is to\nbe authoritative… derives its authority, not at all from force, only to a small extent from habit and custom, really from insight and\nargument.” Under democracies, at least, argumentation complements pure force and arbitrary choice as a basic source of world-\nshaping decisions. Rationality itself has become a source of power; consensual political systems require agreement in thought as\nwell as acquiescence in behavior. Twisting the liberalism of Hegel’s point in light of decades of discussion of the politics of\nrepresentation, we must ask how any given claim comes to count as an insight and from what source arguments derive their\nsocial force.\nThis problem has been addressed most explicitly in the sociology of knowledge. Recent social studies of science have termed the\nepistemological standpoint that assumes a relation between power and knowledge an “equivalence postulate”.

        "comando": "Text\nAs Hegel observed of the emerging democracies of the nineteenth century, in the universe of modern political subjects “what is to\nbe authoritative… derives its authority, not at all from force, only to a small extent from habit and custom, really from insight and\nargument.” Under democracies, at least, argumentation complements pure force and arbitrary choice as a basic source of world-\nshaping decisions. Rationality itself has become a source of power; consensual political systems require agreement in thought as\nwell as acquiescence in behavior. Twisting the liberalism of Hegel’s point in light of decades of discussion of the politics of\nrepresentation, we must ask how any given claim comes to count as an insight and from what source arguments derive their\nsocial force.\nThis problem has been addressed most explicitly in the sociology of knowledge. Recent social studies of science have termed the\nepistemological standpoint that assumes a relation between power and knowledge an “equivalence postulate”. Barry Barnes and\nDavid Bloor, for example, describe this position as follows:\n“Our equivalence postulate is that all beliefs are on a par with one another with respect to the causes of their credibility.

Cognitive models, which are descriptive in nature, provide insight\ninto the mental processes used by developers engaged in software development. The foundation of these mental processes are\nplans, stereotypic solutions to problems. Problem solving is the act of applying and tailoring plans to fit a new problem.\nGeneralized and externalized plans are referred to as patterns.\nSoftware methods provide a structure for mental processes by prescribing a specific set of processes and associated outcomes.\nThis sequence of processes usually includes requirements determination, requirements analysis, design, implementation,\nverification, and maintenance along with one or more outcomes appropriate for each activity.\nMostly, software development can be described in terms of structures, processes, and outcomes. Structure defines the form and\ncontent of outcomes and supports the processes we use to create them. Process refers to the mental and physical activities we\nuse to produce outcomes. Key to understanding mental processes is the concept of leveling, which captures how the behavior of\nmore experienced developers differs from less experienced developers. Outcomes are the things produced. A software method is\na complete structure-process-outcome framework.

Set up near and international summit buzzing with targets, or close to a place where drug-dealers peddle\ntheir wares, these facilities allowed their masters to monitor browsing habits, obtain targets’ logins and passwords, and plant\nspyware for future use. This was legal: consent was buried in the terms and conditions which users clicked on without reading.\nAnd in a neat twist, security-conscious people trying to avoid using their own computers favoured such places. Some would hop\nbetween cafés, unaware that all the convenient ones were run by the authorities.\nNot any more. Edward Snowden, a former contractor for America’s National Security Agency (NSA) now living in Moscow, revealed\nthe use of cyber-cafés to spy on the G20 summit in London in 2009. Now people are wary. In many countries the cyber-cafés\nhave been closed. The staff who ran them have had to be moved (and in some cases given costly new identities).\nThe episode highlights one of the most important trends in modern intelligence work. Collecting electronic information is generally\ngetting easier. It is hard to lead a completely non-digital life, and any activity using computers and networks creates openings for\nthe watchers. An e-mail is as easy to read as a postcard for anyone with modest technical skills. With a few tweaks, mobile\nphones become tracking beacons and bugging devices. Most people readily trade private information for convenience. And\nhacking into computers can yield vast amounts of intelligence.\nA lot of spying, however, has become trickier. It is much more difficult for intelligence officers to maintain secrecy and create fake\nidentities. And high expectations of privacy, especially in the digital realm, mean that in many countries the work of intelligence\nand security agencies arouses outrage, not gratitude.

It\nis “China” who spoke, not (just) the individual person. This is the basis of representation. But what is often forgotten is how non-\nhuman material can represent polities — they are also diplomats, but mute.\nIt may sound ridiculous, if not provocative, to posit that the panda bear in the zoo is China. But this is merely an extension of the\nbasic premise of diplomatic theory. Why should only human individuals be able to represent a state? In periods of conflict, flags\n(material objects) are burnt, walls are erected, monuments torn down; in times of better political mood, heads of states exchange\nprecious gifts with each other, while embassy buildings in foreign countries enjoy a “sacred” legal status. Flags, walls,\nmonuments, gifts, and the embassies re-present, i.e. “bring into presence,” a country, and actions toward these objects address\nthe states they represent.\nAnd there are good grounds for sensing a foreign policy tool in the giant pandas that now reside in zoos all over the world. They\nprominently embody China’s modern public diplomacy; they are non-human material deliberately deployed by the Chinese\ngovernment to the soil of other states; and they have, at times, served as the primary means of expressing inter-state sentiment\n— during times of both conflict and cooperation —, in instances of the so-called “panda diplomacy”.\nAndreas Pacher. The Diplomat. Nov./2017. Internet: <https://thediplomat.com> (adapted).\nConsidering the grammatical and semantic aspects of text II, decide whether the following statements are right (C) or wrong (E).\nIn “But this is merely an extension”, the word “this” refers to the statement that “the panda bear in the zoo is China”.\nCerto\nErrado",

Few persons can embody them all, but the greater\npart of a diplomat’s armoury can be developed and improved by sincere application guided by advice and example of his/her\nseniors.

        "comando": "Text V\nAges ago, I acquired two recordings that inspire a feeling of weirdness whenever I listen to them, or even think about them. Both\nare performances of the great Lerner and Loewe musical My Fair Lady in languages other than English. Each of them has a\nspecial twist of irony. At the core of the original story is how the coarse Cockney girl Liza Doolittle is as a challenge, taken in by\nthe insufferably smug but utterly enthralled professor Henry Higgins, and through painful exercises — “The rain in Spain falls\nmainly in the plain” — acquires such an impeccably upper-class Oxbridge way of speaking English that at her (and his) ultimate\ntest, a posh ball that she attends incognito, drifting among the cream of British society, the keenest linguistic sleuth in the land\ndances with this mysterious beauty and in the end declares her too good to be true, and hence not English elite at all, but\nHungarian!\nThe whole idea of de-anglicizing this story strikes me as really nutty — and yet there they are, those recordings on my shelf. And\nso, on what wet plains do those heavy, drenching rains mainly fall, in Mi Bella Dama? And in the Hungarian version, to what\nelite nationality is the too-good to-be-true unrecognized Cockney girl assigned? Of course, the truly strange part in both cases is\nthat the whole time she is speaking Spanish or Hungarian, the charade is maintained that she is actually speaking English, and,\nunlike most plays or movies where one language is made to pass for another, the linguistic medium here is not just an incidental\nfact, but the very crux of the entire plot. I suppose the suspension of disbelief involved is no more strained than our willingness to\naccept as “reality” a story that is occasionally interrupted by the actors’ breaking into lyrical song, and then, as suddenly as it\nstarted, the singing is over and apparent normalcy resumes on stage.\nDouglas R. Hofstadter. Le ton beau de Marot: in praise of the music of language.

In the past, drivers with residential routes received two printouts each morning: a 30-page document listing more\nthan 1,000 customers they needed to visit that day, and a separate five- or six-page document listing customers with delinquent\naccounts. As drivers made stops, they had to compare the two lists to determine whether to pick up each customer’s containers.\nWith more than 90 drivers in the field, Daily Disposal needed a more efficient way to route trucks and document trash pickup. So,\nthe company invested in a custom mobile app called eMobile, Samsung Galaxy tablets with 10.1-inch screens and cellular service\nfrom Sprint. Rather than receiving stacks of paper each morning, drivers simply download the day’s route onto their tablets via\nthe eMobile app. As they move along, the mounted tablets tell them exactly where to stop. When drivers arrive at customers’\nhomes, they push one of three buttons on the touchscreen: “done,” “not out” or “skip.” Daily Disposal’s entire fleet now has\nmounted tablets. All residential drivers are using the solution, and drivers who pick up from commercial and construction sites will\nbegin using it soon. And the company is looking for other ways to automate operations. “What we’re doing may seem simple, but\nit’s huge for us,” says Todd Ottonello, vice president of the company. “This also helps with our efforts to go green.

There are several topologies, such as\ntree, bus and ring, and the popular mesh and star.\nA mesh topology allows multiple access links between network elements, unlike other types of topologies. The multiplicity of\naccess links between network elements offers an advantage in network reliability because whenever one network element fails,\nthe network does not cease operations; it simply finds a bypass to the failed element and the network remains to function. Mesh\ntopology is most often applied in MAN networks.\nAnother very popular topology, especially in LAN network technologies, is a star topology. A star topology is characterized by a\ncentral prominent node that connects to every other element in the network. So all elements in the network are connected to a\ncentral element. Every network element in a star topology is pairwise connected in a point-to-point manner through the central\nelement, and communication between any pair of elements must go through this central element. The central element or node\ncan operate either in a broadcast fashion, in which case information from one element is broadcast to all connected elements, or\nit can transmit as a switching device in which the incoming data is transmitted only to one element, the nearest element en route\nto the destination. The biggest disadvantage to the star topology in networks is that the failure of the central element results in\nthe failure of the entire network.\nJoseph M. Kizza. Network topology. In: Computer network security. Chattanooga: Springer, 2005, p. 15-7 (adapted).\nIn the text 5A5AAA,\n“it” refers to “network element”.\nCerto\nErrado",

The country’s economic crisis of\n2014—2017 saw a drastic fall in gross domestic product (GDP), stark rise in unemployment, a severe fiscal crisis, and an\nincreased budget deficit. Since then, the economy has been a prominent issue in political conversations, especially regarding\nglobalization and the ways in which trade liberalization can affect economic growth. Those running for office in 2018 differed\nslightly in this debate, and comparing the proposals and backgrounds of their economic advisors was as important as comparing\nthe candidates themselves.\nLara Bartilotti Picanço, Mariana Nozela Prado & Andrew Allen.

The fallout from the cyberattack on the Texas-based software company appears to be vast, with a\nslew of powerful U.S. government agencies and businesses seemingly being infected by hackers who are believed to be affiliated\nwith Russia.\nSolarWinds says it has identified 18,000 customers potentially affected by the incident, which saw the culprits hijack software\nupdates for a widely-used IT monitoring tool called \"Orion\" to spread malware, seemingly with the intention of espionage. The\nconsequences of the brazen cyber-assault, which was first discovered by security firm FireEye after it too was infiltrated by the\nsame group, are yet to be understood. But experts fear the hackers' access could be exploited to steal sensitive information or\ndestroy and falsify government data, and warn it could take years to fix.\nWhile the full list of victims is unclear — and expanding almost daily — Microsoft said its teams had identified more than 40 of its\ncustomers the attackers had aimed at \"more precisely and compromised through additional and sophisticated measures.\"\nIt now seems likely the scope of the victims could be broad. Microsoft said the initial list included security, technology and non-\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) alongside the government targets. It said 80 percent of attacks that it logged were U.S.\nbased. \"This is not 'espionage as usual,' even in the digital age. Instead, it represents an act of recklessness that created a serious\ntechnological vulnerability for the United States and the world,\" Brad Smith, president of the U.S. tech giant, wrote on Thursday.\n\"The attack unfortunately represents a broad and successful espionage-based assault on both the confidential information of the\nU.S. government and the tech tools used by firms to protect them. The attack is ongoing,\" the executive continued. Analysis is\nongoing to determine which companies were impacted by the hack, as just because an entity used Orion is not evidence that it\nwas actively compromised.\nInternet: <www.newsweek.com> (adapted).\nConsidering the text above, judge the following item.",

At the same time, natural gas, coal, wind and nuclear facilities in Texas have been knocked offline by the unthinkably\nlow temperatures.\n“The extreme cold is causing the entire system to freeze up,” said Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University’s Center on\nGlobal Energy Policy. “All sources of energy are underperforming in the extreme cold because they’re not designed to handle\nthese unusual conditions.”\nThe ripple effects are being felt around the nation as Texas’ prolific oil-and-gas industry stumbles.\nIt’s striking that these power outages are happening in a state with abundant energy resources. Texas produces more electricity\nthan any other US state — generating almost twice as much as Florida, the next-closest, according to federal statistics.\nWind power is also booming in Texas, which produced about 28% of all the US wind-powered electricity in 2019, the EIA said. But\nthe problem is that not only is Texas an energy superpower, it tends to be an above-average temperature state.\nThat means its infrastructure is ill-prepared for the cold spell currently wreaking havoc. And the consequences are being felt by\nmillions.\nCritics of renewable energy have pointed out that wind turbines have frozen or needed to be shut down due to the extreme\nweather.\nEven though other places with colder weather (like Iowa and Denmark) rely on wind for even larger shares of power, experts said\nthe turbines in Texas were not winterized for the unexpected freeze.\nBut this is not just about wind turbines going down.\nNatural gas and coal-fired power plants need water to stay online.\nYet those water facilities froze in the cold temperatures and others lost access to the electricity they require to operate.\nIt’s too early to definitively say what went wrong in Texas and how to prevent similar outages. More information will need to be\nreleased by state authorities. Still, some experts say the criticism of wind power appears overdone already. “In terms of the blame\ngame, the focus on wind is a red herring. It’s more of a political issue than what is causing the power problems on the grid,” said\nDan Cohan, associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University.\nThe energy crisis in Texas raises also questions about the nature of the state’s deregulated and decentralized electric grid. Unlike\nother states, Texas has made a conscious decision to isolate its grid from the rest of the country.\nThat means that when things are running smoothly, Texas can’t export excess power to neighboring states. And in the current\ncrisis, it can’t import power either.\nInternet: <www.cnn.com> (adapted).\nAbout ideas stated in the text above and the words used in it, judge the following item.",

At the same time, natural gas, coal, wind and nuclear facilities in Texas have been knocked offline by the unthinkably\nlow temperatures.\n“The extreme cold is causing the entire system to freeze up,” said Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University’s Center on\nGlobal Energy Policy. “All sources of energy are underperforming in the extreme cold because they’re not designed to handle\nthese unusual conditions.”\nThe ripple effects are being felt around the nation as Texas’ prolific oil-and-gas industry stumbles.\nIt’s striking that these power outages are happening in a state with abundant energy resources. Texas produces more electricity\nthan any other US state — generating almost twice as much as Florida, the next-closest, according to federal statistics.\nWind power is also booming in Texas, which produced about 28% of all the US wind-powered electricity in 2019, the EIA said. But\nthe problem is that not only is Texas an energy superpower, it tends to be an above-average temperature state.\nThat means its infrastructure is ill-prepared for the cold spell currently wreaking havoc. And the consequences are being felt by\nmillions.\nCritics of renewable energy have pointed out that wind turbines have frozen or needed to be shut down due to the extreme\nweather.\nEven though other places with colder weather (like Iowa and Denmark) rely on wind for even larger shares of power, experts said\nthe turbines in Texas were not winterized for the unexpected freeze.\nBut this is not just about wind turbines going down.\nNatural gas and coal-fired power plants need water to stay online.\nYet those water facilities froze in the cold temperatures and others lost access to the electricity they require to operate.\nIt’s too early to definitively say what went wrong in Texas and how to prevent similar outages. More information will need to be\nreleased by state authorities. Still, some experts say the criticism of wind power appears overdone already. “In terms of the blame\ngame, the focus on wind is a red herring. It’s more of a political issue than what is causing the power problems on the grid,” said\nDan Cohan, associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University.\nThe energy crisis in Texas raises also questions about the nature of the state’s deregulated and decentralized electric grid. Unlike\nother states, Texas has made a conscious decision to isolate its grid from the rest of the country.\nThat means that when things are running smoothly, Texas can’t export excess power to neighboring states. And in the current\ncrisis, it can’t import power either.\nInternet: <www.cnn.com> (adapted).\nAbout ideas stated in the text above and the words used in it, judge the following item.",

Police typically are responsible for\nmaintaining public order and safety, enforcing the law, and preventing, detecting, and investigating criminal activities. These\nfunctions are known as policing. Police are often also entrusted with various licensing and regulatory activities. However, police\nscholars have criticized this popular understanding of the word “police” — that it refers to members of a public organization\nhaving the legal competence to maintain order and enforce the law — for two reasons. First, it defines police by their ends rather\nthan by the specific means that they use to achieve their goals. Second, the variety of situations in which police are asked to\nintervene is much greater than law enforcement and order maintenance.\nThere is now a consensus among researchers that the common feature among all the different agencies engaged in policing is the\nlegal competence to enforce coercive, nonnegotiable measures to resolve problematic situations. Such situations are characterized\nby their potential for harm and the need to solve them urgently before they develop that potential.

        "comando": "China has charged ahead with a bold effort to remake the way that government-backed money works, rolling out its own\ndigital currency with different qualities than cash or digital deposits. The country’s central bank started testing a new electronic\ncurrency, which was named electronic Chinese yuan or eCNY, last year in four cities and have recently expanded those trials to\nbigger cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, according to government presentations. No other major power is as far along with a\nhomegrown digital currency.\nThe effort is one of several by central banks around the world to try new forms of digital money that can move faster and give\neven the most disadvantaged people access to online financial tools. Digital currencies created by central banks give governments\nmore of a financial grip. These currencies can enable direct handouts of money that expire if not used by a particular date and\ncan make it easier for governments to track financial transactions to stamp out tax evasion and crack down on dissidents.\nIf the eCNY is successful, it will give the central bank new powers, including novel types of monetary policy to help the economy\ngrow. In one possibility that economists have discussed, a central bank could program its digital currency to slowly lose value so\nthat consumers are encouraged to spend it immediately. Also, the eCNY could immediately give the Chinese government more\npower to monitor finance flows because a digital currency system can record every transaction.\nInternet: <www.nytimes.com> (adapted).\nJudge the following item, concerning the ideas stated in the text and the words used in it.",

Furthermore,\neven teaching materials do not reflect the conclusions of current research, and they can be perceived as boring; however, Baker\nargues that teachers who complete a pronunciation course have, and apply, a wider range of pronunciation activities in their\nclassrooms.\nH.

This difficulty\nhas nothing to do with intelligence or level of education, or even with knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary.\nOf course, there is no simple answer to why pronunciation is so difficult to learn — indeed, there is a whole range of theoretical\nperspectives on the question. What is generally accepted among psycholinguists and phonologists who specialized in this area is\nthat the difficulty in learning to pronounce a foreign language is cognitive rather than physical, and that it has something to do\nwith the way “raw sound” is categorized or conceptualized in using speech.\nMany learners of English as a second language have major difficulties with English pronunciation even after years of learning the\nlanguage. This often results in them facing difficulties in areas such as finding employment. Up to a certain proficiency standard,\nthe fault which most severely impairs the communication process in EFL/ESL learners is pronunciation, not vocabulary or\ngrammar.\nA. Gilakjani and M. Ahmadi.

For example, certain ransomware gangs may use the exact\nsame type of encryption in all their attacks. “White hat” hackers can and do study these trends, which allows them to retrieve and\npublish the decryption keys for specific types of ransomware. Many companies, however, remain reluctant to admit they have\nexperienced a breach, wishing to avoid potential bad press. Overcoming that reluctance may require legislation, such as a bill\nintroduced in the Senate last year that would require companies to report having paid a ransom within 24 hours of the\ntransaction.\nInternet: <www.scientificamerican.com> (adapted).\nIn the second paragraph of the text,\nthe word “disincentivize” could be correctly replaced by deter without any change in the meaning of the sentence.\nCerto\nErrado",

Following in the path of\nMontreal, Paris, and Cardiff, London mayor Boris Johnson is to unveil the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme this Friday, and Londoners\nand visitors will have access to almost-free bike hire in 30-minute bursts. Over the past few weeks new docking stations have\nbeen appearing\nacross central London in readiness for the 6,000 bikes that will be available for rent. The scheme is modelled on the Bixi project\nthat has become a big success in the Canadian city of Montreal, and even uses similar bikes. Once you’ve paid a £1 a day access\ncharge, the first half an hour’s rental is free, and you can make as many 30-minute trips in the day as you like without paying a\npenny more.\nFrom this Friday, and for the first month, it will only be open to those who become members by registering online and agreeing to\npay £3 for a smartcard. After that period the scheme will be opened to everyone. Once fully up and running, spontaneous users\nwill be able to go to one of the capital’s 400 docking stations, enter their credit or debit card details, select a bike and ride off.\nWhen they have finished that journey, they deposit the bike at the nearest docking station. You can repeat this as many times as\nyou like during the day – or in the period for which you have paid to access the bikes.\nTransport for London, which is behind the scheme, says it is aimed at those in the capital who need to make short, repeated\njourneys, rather than longer rentals. Potential users need to be aware that if they return their bike after their access time has\nexpired, they face a punitive £150 late return charge. If the bike goes missing, or is damaged by the hirer – or vandals – the hirer\nwill have to pay up to £300 to cover the loss. Punctures are considered wear and tear.\nMiles Brignall.

A suburban\ntrain system is to replace hundreds of thousands of vehicles.\nThe potential payoff for such efforts is now in sight: Mexico City does not even rank among the top 10 polluted cities worldwide.\nMexico City appears to have cut most of its pollutants at least by half, while recent studies show a number of cities in China and\nIndia recording higher levels of the most serious pollutants. In 1992, the United Nations declared Mexico City the most polluted on\nthe planet. High ozone levels were thought to cause 1,000 deaths and 35,000 hospitalizations a year. Mexico was forced to act. It\nreplaced the city’s sootbelching old cars, removed lead from gasoline, embraced natural gas, expanded public transportation, and\nrelocated refineries and factories. Change was gradual, but the pace has quickened in recent years. The presence of lead in the\nair has dropped by 90 percent since 1990. Suspended particles – pieces of dust, soot or chemicals that lodge in lungs and cause\nasthma, emphysema or cancer – have been cut by 70 percent. Carbon monoxide and other pollutants also have been drastically\nreduced.\nAnne-Marie O’Connor. Mexico City drastically reduced air pollutants since the 1990s. In: The Washington Post.

But 1616 also saw the passing of another\ngreat writer: Miguel de Cervantes y Saavedra, who we know best as the author of Don Quijote.\nAs Shakespeare left an indelible mark on the English language, Spanish has been referred to as the language of Cervantes. This is\ndue not just to the inventiveness of Cervantes’ writing, but also to its orality. To read Don Quijote is to engage deeply with the\nact of storytelling in many forms. Indeed, almost any given character becomes a storyteller, through writing or reciting, dialogue\nor monologue.\nWith his ear for the spoken word, it should come as no surprise that Cervantes tried his hand as a playwright as well as a novelist.\nAlthough he yearned for recognition as the former, his true fame came as the latter. Don Quijote was published in two parts, the\nfirst in 1605 to almost immediate acclaim, and its sequel in 1615, the same year Cervantes published his Ocho comedias y ocho\nentremeses (i.e. Eight comedies and eight dramatic interludes).\nApril 23, 1616, is given as the death date for both Shakespeare and Cervantes, but neither man died on that day. Spanish records\nfrom that time write down the date of death as the date of burial. So we know Cervantes was buried on April 23, which means he\nprobably died on April 22. Shakespeare actually died 11 days after Cervantes — May 3 by the Gregorian calendar that Spain\nadopted in 1582, but April 23 on the Julian calendar that England used until 1752.\nKathryn Swanton.

Military leaders have certainly managed to change large parts of it; scientists devising\ncures and vaccines for disease can spread a more benign influence across whole continents; the thoughts of religious leaders or\nphilosophers can sweep through generations like fire. But books?\nReading books is generally a solitary pastime: bookishness is the very antithesis of the man-of-action qualities that seem to shake\nthe world. The pen may boast of being mightier than the sword, but it is generally the sword that wins in the short term. It is that\nphrase, though, which gives the game away: in the short term, writers can be imprisoned or executed, their work censored, and\ntheir books burned, but over history, it is books and the ideas expressed within them that have transformed the world.\nBut which books can be said to have changed the world? There are few better ways of starting an argument than producing a list,\nand I have no doubt that not everyone will be happy about the books I included in my list. About some, like the Bible,\nShakespeare’s First Folio and Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, there can be little argument — but what about Euclid’s\nElements, Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man or A Vindication of the Rights of Women by Mary Wollstonecraft?

This is evident in banks, schools and other organizations where members of staff organize “Divali” cultural\nprogrammes, dress in Indian ethnic wear and distribute sweets to their staff and customers.\nOne of the highpoints of the celebrations is held at the Divali Nagar site which is the official headquarters of the National Council\nof Indian Culture. At the Nagar there is a week of cultural, religious, educational and commercial activities which attract a wide\ncross section of the population including members of government, diplomatic agencies and parliamentarians.\nHindus in Trinidad and Tobago are also involved in cleaning and redecorating their homes for this auspicious occasion. They also\nmaintain a period of abstinence or fasting. The day of “Divali” is marked with a host of activities in the homes where various\ndishes and sweets are prepared and “Pooja” is performed. Family members participate in evening worship at 6 o’clock to Mother\nLakshmi, the Goddess of prosperity and wealth. They then light their homes with several dozens of “deyas” and distribute\ndelicacies to their families, friends and the community. This sacred festival is known to bring about positive feelings to the\ncommunity such as a sense of unity, cleanliness, harmony and festivity.\nInternet: www2.nalis.gov.tt (adapted).\nBased on the text, judge the item below.",

Likely, you’re reading this on your\ncomputer, smartphone, or tablet. Mining touches all our lives daily (in addition to metals used in electronics, think about that can\nof soda you are drinking, or the aggregate used to pave your driveway). The industry works hard to make sure the net impact is\npositive.\nHowever, the waste associated with mining, both past and present, is an unavoidable result of conventional mineral processing. In\nthe future it may be possible to extract metals like copper and gold without crushing and grinding the ore down to fine particle\nsize and adding considerable quantities of liquid, resulting in conventional tailings.\nWhat are the challenges associated with conventional tailings? Well, it is all about water. Managing seepage from the tailings\nthemselves, monitoring pore water pressure within the tailings dams or designing facilities to safely store or pass flood events.\nBecause such a significant quantity of water is added during mineral processing, “conventional” tailings dams store the tailings as\na slurry. Water within the tailing material is either evaporated, migrates as seepage or remains entrained within the tailings\nimpoundment. Removing water prior to disposal through various means is considered “alternative” disposal. Mining low grades of\nore has resulted in increased water use per unit of production. In some cases, the availability of water is one of the greatest\nconstraints on mine development.\nInternet: <www.stantec.com> (adapted).\nConsidering the ideas stated in the text and the vocabulary used in it, judge the following items.",

Researchers at the University of Leeds, in England, say plant ecology —\nwhich studies the distribution and abundance of plants, the effect of the environment on them and how they interact with the\nenvironment — is also not taught well enough. “We ignore the opportunities presented to us by the botanical world at our own\nperil,” said lead study author and doctoral student Seb Stroud.\nThis data is also corroborated by the Scottish government, which said there are not enough skilled people to implement “nature-\nbased solutions” to rising temperatures. The University of Leeds team also argued that people’s inability to identify plants could\nmake the spread of invasive plants worse.

It added that it now wants to help those whose languages aren’t represented in most technology. The\nnew languages range from Bhojpuri, which is spoken in northern India, Nepal and Fiji, to Dhivehi, with its estimated 300,000\nspeakers in the Maldives.\nThe move now brings to 133 the total number of languages available on Google Translate as of May 2022. The company says the\nnew languages also represent a technical milestone, explaining that they use a machine learning model which learns to translate\ninto another language without ever seeing an example. This can be useful for languages where large datasets of human\ntranslations, which can be used to train a computer, are not available. But the company admits that the technology isn’t perfect.\nSo, will the translations be accurate? Some polyglots have noted problems with the languages already available. “For many\nsupported languages, the translation is not great. It will definitely get the idea across but often it will lose much of the subtlety of\nthe language,” Google Translate research scientist Isaac Caswell told the BBC.\nWith the new languages, he said, it would be no different. But the people who helped in the research said it was a good place to\nstart. “My impression from other people I have talked to was that it was a very positive thing for them,” Mr Caswell said.

If you don’t have previous experience, good contacts, or a good degree from a well-known university,\nyou may want to apply for a lower-level job first. Also, find out what the job you are seeking typically pays in your area. If you are\nyoung, unemployed or are struggling financially, try and keep your salary expectations a bit lower than the average.

The answer is\nsomewhat complicated. Because the vocabulary of a language serves only the members of the society who speak it, the question\nto be asked should be: Is a particular vocabulary sufficient to serve the sociocultural needs of those who use the language? When\nput like this, it follows that the language associated with a relatively simple culture would have a smaller vocabulary than the\nlanguage of a complex society. Why, for example, should the Inuit people (often known by the pejorative term “Eskimo”) have\nwords for chlorofluoromethane, dune buggy, or tae kwon do when these substances, objects, and concepts play no part in their\nculture? By the same token, however, the language of a tribal society would have elaborate lexical domains for prominent aspects\nof the culture although these do not exist in complex societies. The Agta of the Philippines, for example, are reported to have no\nfewer than thirty-one verbs referring to types of fishing, while in Munich, the terminology for the local varieties of beer is quite\nextensive, according to strength, color, fizziness, aging, and clarity, the full list exceeding seventy terms.\nHowever, even though no language spoken today may be labeled primitive, this does not mean that all languages do all things in\nthe same way, or are equally influential in the modern transnational world. The linguistic anthropologist Dell Hymes claims that\nlanguages are not functionally equivalent because the role of speech varies from one society to the next. According to Hymes,\nthough all languages “are potentially equal and hence capable of adaptation to the needs of a complex industrial civilization”, only\ncertain languages have actually done so (Hymes 1961:77). These languages are more successful than others not because they\nare structurally more advanced, but because they happen to be associated with societies in which language is the basis of\nliterature, education, science, and commerce.\nZdenek SALZMANN, James M.

Yet for all her street cred, Chou still finds herself grappling with one of the biggest problems in the\nindustry: Female programmers are regarded skeptically, and sometimes even treated with flat-out hostility. She’s seen the same\npattern of behavior personally during her decade in coding: colleagues who muse openly about whether women are biologically\nless wired to be great programmers.\nThere’s a deep irony here — because women were in computing from its earliest days. Indeed, they were considered essential\nback when “computers” were not even yet machines. Just before the digital age emerged, computers were humans. And for a\ntime, a large portion of them were women.\nSoon, the human computers faced an even more existential threat: digital computers, which promised to work with far greater\nspeed and to handle complex math.\nWomen, though, were among the original coders of these strange new digital brains, because in the early days programming was\nseen as dull work. The earliest programmers for the Eniac — the military-funded first programmable general-purpose computer —\nwere entirely women. And though they wound up inventing brilliant coding techniques, they received none of the glory: When the\nArmy showed off the Eniac to the press, it did not introduce the women who had written the code.\nInternet: <smithsonianmag.com> (adapted)\nJudge the following item about the previous text and the information stated in it as well as the vocabulary used in it.",

Of course, these choices are constrained depending on social locations like race, class, and gender, but\ngenerally speaking, human rights safeguard the basic tenets of what makes human lives worth living. Animal rights aim to do\nsomething similar, only for non-human animals.\nAnimal rights come into direct opposition with animal exploitation, which includes animals used by humans for a variety of\nreasons, be it for food, as experimental objects, or even pets. Animal rights can also be violated when it comes to human\ndestruction of animal habitats. This negatively impacts the ability of animals to lead full lives of their choosing.\nInternet: <thehumaneleague.org > (adapted).\nConsidering the ideas and linguistic aspects of the text above, judge the item below.",

But it’s important to get as much sleep as you\ncan. Getting up early in the morning is no easy task for plenty of people. That’s why alarms are important — they ensure that you\nwake up at your desired time. However, nobody can deny how tempting it is to try and squeeze in a few more minutes of sleep.\nAccording to a survey, about 57 percent of people snooze in the morning, which is defined as needing multiple alarms to wake up.\nIf you set a single alarm and snooze it repeatedly or set several alarms at regular intervals until the time you absolutely need to\nget up, you are a snoozer.

Meanwhile, rising sea levels — projected by Israel’s Environment Ministry to be as high as a meter by 2050,\naccording to a new investigative report by Haaretz newspaper — threaten to obliterate Israel’s famed beaches, damage its\ndesalination plants and undermine the sewage and drainage systems of many coastal cities. In the densely populated Gaza strip,\nwhere 2.1 million Palestinians are crammed into 365 square km (141 sq. mi.), sea level rise means a loss of precious real estate\nas well as saltwater intrusion into an already overtaxed aquifer.\nIn an arid region already threatened by desertification and declining precipitation, one would think that the looming climate\ncatastrophe would catalyze a powerful climate movement. Instead, the whole thing is largely an afterthought. In Israel and the\nPalestinian territories the threat is both existential and more acute. In this contested land, climate action is hamstrung by zero-\nsum battles over territorial, political and historic rights, even as a warming climate exacerbates those tensions.\nAryn Baker.

It poses threats to ways of life,\nlivelihoods, health, safety and security for women and girls around the world.\nIt is important to acknowledge that the climate crisis is not “gender neutral”. Across the world, women depend more on, yet have\nless access to, natural resources. In many regions, women bear a disproportionate responsibility for securing food, water, and\nfuel. Agriculture is the most important employment sector for women in low- and lower-middle income countries. During periods\nof drought and erratic rainfall, women, as agricultural workers and primary procurers, work harder to secure income and\nresources for their families. This puts added pressure on girls, who often have to leave school to help their mothers manage the\nincreased burden.\nClimate change is a “threat multiplier”, meaning it escalates social, political and economic tensions in fragile and conflict-affected\nsettings. As climate change drives conflict across the world, women and girls face increased vulnerabilities to all forms of gender-\nbased violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, human trafficking, child marriage, and other forms of violence.\nUNWomen.

This module explores how nature and\nenvironmental writing can be politicised in defence of local, state, and federal land protections — whether by writers themselves,\nor by conservationists, activists, policymakers, and others. We will study the intersections of page and place through a selection of\nnonfiction environmental texts from the mid-nineteenth century onwards that have informed and moulded on-the-ground land\nconservation practices, or contributed to environmental regulation and legislation. We will also look at how fiction — such as\nclimate fiction, speculative fiction, and graphic novels — has emerged as another platform for commentary on the environmental\ncondition. This module offers geographical approaches and tools to help students explore the contributions of environmental\nwriting to conservation campaigns, and its place in wider environmental activism and protest narratives.

Advanced\neconomies’ emissions dropped to a 50-year low while coal demand fell back to levels not seen since the early 1900s. The decline\nin advanced economies’ emissions was driven by a combination of strong renewables deployment, coal-to-gas switching, energy\nefficiency improvements and softer industrial production.\nInternet: <www.engineeringnews.co.za/> (adapted).\nAccording to the text, judge the following statemens.\nWithout the impact of low hydropower output, global CO emissions from electricity generation would have decreased in 2023,\n2\nmaking the overall rise in energy-related emissions significantly smaller.\nCerto\nErrado",

By tapping into the value of data and green infrastructure, smart cities can combat climate risks and become\nmore resilient to the many unexpected events of today’s increasingly unpredictable world.

Conducted by Dr.\nMatti Vuorre and his team at Tilburg University and published in Technology, Mind, and Behavior magazine, the study analyzed\ndata from more than two million people across 168 countries. The findings suggest that those who have Internet access and\nactively use it report higher well-being across areas like life satisfaction, social life, and economic stability. Remarkably, 85% of the\ndata analyses revealed that Internet users generally experience greater well-being than non-users. Dr. Vuorre emphasized that\nalthough Internet use is often blamed for mental health issues, this large-scale study suggests a positive correlation between\naccess to the Internet and improved well-being.\nThe study used Gallup World Poll data to assess well-being, looking at whether Internet access was associated with positive\noutcomes on a global scale. Dr. Vuorre acknowledged the complexity of analyzing such extensive data, so his team conducted\ntens of thousands of statistical tests to ensure reliability. While the study adjusts for factors like income and access to healthcare,\nwhich can independently boost well-being, Internet access still appeared to make a positive difference. However, Dr. Markus\nAppel, a psychology professor not involved in the study, noted that Internet use’s impact on well-being may vary greatly based on\nindividual use. Appel pointed out that the Internet itself is not inherently good or bad for mental health; rather, its effects depend\non how people choose to use it.\nThe study calls for a nuanced view of Internet use. Dr. Vuorre emphasized that the Internet supports various activities, from\nonline banking and shopping to social interactions and news consumption, each with unique effects on well-being. Yet, the rapid\nshift to digital life leaves limited time to study these impacts fully. Vuorre noted that caution is warranted in framing policies\naround Internet use. Although some research highlights negative effects of social media, especially for younger people, this study\nsuggests that Internet access may be a valuable resource, enhancing certain aspects of well-being worldwide.\nInternet: <edition.cnn.com> (adapted).\nAccording to the text above, judge the following item.",

While researchers expect to see older children socialised to particular gender roles, they were\nshocked to see similar patterns of behaviour starting to emerge at such a young age. They fear it could have long-term\nimplications for girls’ health, as girls are less physically active as they get older and are more likely than boys to have difficulties\nwith their mental health.\nThe study also found that preschool-age child ren from a minority ethnic background play less outdoors than their white\ncounterparts, and children in urban areas play less outdoors than those in rural areas. “The results highlight inequalities in play\neven in the youn gest age group, which may exacerbate existing inequalities in health,” the report concluded.\nThe research surveyed more than 1,100 parents and carers of children aged two, three and four. They found that preschool\nchildren spent approximately four hours a day at play, of which one hour and 45 minutes was spent playing outdoors, mainly in\nback gardens at home. Away from home, children played in playgrounds and green spaces, with the most adventurous play\nusually associated with indoor play centres.\n“The popularity of these play centers is growing,” the report said. “This may be driven by indoor play centres providing\nadventurous play experiences that overcome some of the barriers to outdoor adventurous play such as traffic, weather and safety\nconcerns.”\nSally Weale.

Here are key areas where ChatGPT can play a significant role in education\naccording to his studies.\nPersonalized Learning\nThough a digital tool, ChatGPT offers personalized learning experiences. It adapts to students’ unique learning styles through\npersonalized recommendations based on their history. This allows students to receive targeted answers and support in any subject\nthey need help with. ChatGPT also helps students build on topics they’re investigating by creating useful frameworks. Similarly,\nteachers can use it to craft content specific to their lessons and generate information for classroom discussions.\nVirtual Tutoring\nChatGPT functions as a flexible virtual tutor, offering instant support. Unlike a one-size-fits-all approach, it adjusts to the students’\nneeds and provides immediate answers, which helps to reduce frustration and increases confidence. Students working under tight\ndeadlines especially benefit from this on-demand access to help, as it allows them to solve problems quickly and avoid missing\nimportant project deadlines. ChatGPT can alsoidentify areas where students struggle, providing targeted assistance in real time.\nLanguage Learning\nChatGPT can also aid language learners. Like grammarly helps with writing, ChatGPT offers real-time translations, grammar\ncorrections, and pronunciation feedback. Students struggling with language can improve their writing skills and gain confidence in\ntheir communication. The platform’s language prompts also make it easier to create targeted content, which is especially useful in\nforeign language classes. Teachers can fine-tune ChatGPT’s outputs to better meet specific class needs, enriching the learning\nexperience.\nExam Preparation\nWhen it comes to preparing for exams, ChatGPT is a powerful tool. It generates practice questions and gives feedback on student\nresponses, helping students pinpoint areas they need to focus on. This makes ChatGPT a personalized study guide. Additionally, it\nprovides grammar and vocabulary exercises, reducing study time while adding value to each session. These exercises can help\nstudents prepare for assessments more efficiently and build confidence.\nWriting Assistance\nWriting essays or assignments can feel daunting, but ChatGPT simplifies the process. It helps students generate topic ideas,\ncorrects grammar and spelling, and suggests improvements to writing style. Acting like an online editor, ChatGPT streamlines\ncontent creation. Beyond basic writing help, it also fosters critical thinking and analytical skills. ChatGPT can process data, mirror\nhuman thinking, and deliver responses that help students draw logical conclusions and present their arguments clearly.\nInternet: <digitallearninginstitute.com> (adapted).\nAccording to the previous text, judge the follow item.",

Here are key areas where ChatGPT can play a significant role in education\naccording to his studies.\nPersonalized Learning\nThough a digital tool, ChatGPT offers personalized learning experiences. It adapts to students’ unique learning styles through\npersonalized recommendations based on their history. This allows students to receive targeted answers and support in any subject\nthey need help with. ChatGPT also helps students build on topics they’re investigating by creating useful frameworks. Similarly,\nteachers can use it to craft content specific to their lessons and generate information for classroom discussions.\nVirtual Tutoring\nChatGPT functions as a flexible virtual tutor, offering instant support. Unlike a one-size-fits-all approach, it adjusts to the students’\nneeds and provides immediate answers, which helps to reduce frustration and increases confidence. Students working under tight\ndeadlines especially benefit from this on-demand access to help, as it allows them to solve problems quickly and avoid missing\nimportant project deadlines. ChatGPT can alsoidentify areas where students struggle, providing targeted assistance in real time.\nLanguage Learning\nChatGPT can also aid language learners. Like grammarly helps with writing, ChatGPT offers real-time translations, grammar\ncorrections, and pronunciation feedback. Students struggling with language can improve their writing skills and gain confidence in\ntheir communication. The platform’s language prompts also make it easier to create targeted content, which is especially useful in\nforeign language classes. Teachers can fine-tune ChatGPT’s outputs to better meet specific class needs, enriching the learning\nexperience.\nExam Preparation\nWhen it comes to preparing for exams, ChatGPT is a powerful tool. It generates practice questions and gives feedback on student\nresponses, helping students pinpoint areas they need to focus on. This makes ChatGPT a personalized study guide. Additionally, it\nprovides grammar and vocabulary exercises, reducing study time while adding value to each session. These exercises can help\nstudents prepare for assessments more efficiently and build confidence.\nWriting Assistance\nWriting essays or assignments can feel daunting, but ChatGPT simplifies the process. It helps students generate topic ideas,\ncorrects grammar and spelling, and suggests improvements to writing style. Acting like an online editor, ChatGPT streamlines\ncontent creation. Beyond basic writing help, it also fosters critical thinking and analytical skills. ChatGPT can process data, mirror\nhuman thinking, and deliver responses that help students draw logical conclusions and present their arguments clearly.\nInternet: <digitallearninginstitute.com> (adapted).\nAccording to the previous text, judge the follow item.",

The impact of climate change on drylands is also generally thought to be negative, with\nsome studies suggesting that anthropogenic forcing has already increased arid areas.\nDespite evidence for land use-induced degradation and the studies that find increased aridification over drylands, satellite\nestimates of vegetation greenness show a significant global increase since 1980. The key drivers of this global increase in\napparent vegetation productivity are the vegetation’s response to rising CO , increases in rainfall and temperature and land use.\n2\nModel simulations which prescribe land use, attribute almost all of the trend in satellite-derived greening to CO fertilization, while\n2\nsatellite-derived models that do not account for CO , explicitly find either climate or land use as the dominate factor. Neither\n2\napproach explicitly accounts for rapid ecosystem change in their proportioning of the relative contributions of each driver. This can\nlead them to miss or underestimate rapid changes driven by processes like extreme fires, deforestation, reforestation, changes in\nagricultural policy, etc. Disentangling the roles of climate (temperature and precipitation), CO and land use thus remains a key\n2\nchallenge.\nA.L. Burrell; J.P. Evans; M.G. De Kauwe. Anthropogenic\nclimate change has driven over 5 million km2 of drylands towards desertification.

Currently, large and sophisticated cybercrimes continue to be\ndeployed today. They are also becoming more expensive for the targeted companies and organizations. The average global cost\nof a data breach reached US$ 4.45 million last year, according to the latest research, the highest level ever recorded.\nIn Davos, experts maintain that so-called security by design is key to bolstering cyber resilience. The concept of security by design\nentails building cybersecurity protocols into software and hardware products from the earliest development stage. This approach\nallows safeguards to be embedded at each state of operation and limits the chances of cybersecurity vulnerabilities emerging as\nproducts develop and are put into use.\n“It has become an imperative for the digital public infrastructure,” Debjani Ghosh, President of Indian technology non-profit\nNASSCOM, said of security by design.\nThe international community needs to “start thinking about the processes we can put in place to make sure that we can support\neach other and defend each other’s public infrastructures,” Sadie Creese, a Professor of Cybersecurity at the University of Oxford,\nsaid in Davos.\nInternet: <weforum.org> (adapted).\nBased on text CG2A1-I, judge the following item.",

The injunctions of morality, even when reinforced by the vision of the monotheistic higher\nreligions, conflict with reason and self-interest. Man is divided against himself. And therefore men become divided against\nthemselves in new cleavages of rich and poor, in-group and out-group, faithful and infidel, orthodox and heterodox, my side and\nyour side.\nFrederick L. Schuman. International politics:\nthe destiny of the Western State System. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1948.\nAccording to the preceding text, judge the follow item.",
