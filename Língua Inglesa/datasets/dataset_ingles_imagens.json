        "comando": "Text IV\nA central conjecture of the social studies of finance is that equipment matters: it changes the nature of the economic agent, of\neconomic action, and of markets.\nConsider, for example, physical equipment such as the stock ticker or trading screens connected in electronic networks, which\ncircumvent the most basic of all bodily limitations — the inability to be in two places at once. They made fine-grained knowledge\nof price movements available in close to real time to geographically dispersed market participants. Alex Preda conjectures, for\ninstance, that the ticker helped prompt the rise of “chartism” or “technical analysis”: the belief — still widespread — that patterns\ncan be found in price graphs that have predictive value. Actors’ equipment goes beyond physical technologies: their “conceptual\nequipment” also matters, or so the social studies of finance posit. Financial markets are complicated places. Given the limited\nmemory and computational capacity of the human brain, economic agents must develop and acquire systematic ways of making\nsense of markets. Organizations must develop procedures for interacting with markets, and to an increasing extent those\nprocedures are implemented in algorithms in automated pricing, trading and risk-management systems.\nSometimes, the ways of thinking, procedures, and algorithms that are employed derive from financial economics. Probably more\noften, however, practitioners’ ways of thinking and associated ways of acting have no direct connection to “academic” economics\nor indeed are regarded by economists as mistaken. Chartism is an example of the latter: financial economists regard it as on a par\nwith astrology, but many traders take it seriously, and act on the basis of it.\n“Public facts”, such as the LIBOR1, technical equipment, graphical presentations, and “conceptual equipment” are all aspects of\nthe diverse cognitive and calculative processes that take place in financial markets. These processes are “distributed” in the sense\nthat a given task is often performed not by a single unaided human but by multiple human beings, objects, and technical systems.\nTo understand cognition that involves multiple collaborating human beings and/or interaction with objects and technical systems,\none must go beyond the psychological or cognitive science analysis of the individual “bounded by the skin”.\nAs Hutchins puts it, “a group performing [a] cognitive task may have cognitive properties that differ from the cognitive properties\nof any individual”.\nLIBOR stands for London interbank offered rate.\nThe interest rate at which banks offer to lend funds (wholesale money) to one another in the international interbank market (source: Financial Times).\nDonald MacKenzie. Material Markets. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 13-6 (adapted).\nConsidering the grammatical and semantic aspects of text IV, decide whether the following items are right (C) or wrong (E).\nThe expression “on a par with” means competing.\nCerto\nErrado",

Then the screen went dark and the infants overheard a conversation that included a nonsense word: “blick.”\nSome babies heard a sentence with an action verb like “The blick eats.” Others heard a sentence like “The blick is over here,” with\nno action verb.\nThe infants then again saw the screen with an animal and an inanimate object.

They came in the house and sat around the window, exclaiming and\ntaking pictures with big cameras.\nThere always seemed to be three or four of them wandering around our place, discussing the body fat of hummingbirds**.\nIn those days, wild turkey were rare, and the pure-strain wild turkeys had begun to interbreed with farmers’ domestic stock. It\nwas extinction by dilution.\nOne ornithologist had devised a method to compute the ratio of domestic to pure-strain wild turkey in an individual bird by\ncomparing the angle of flight at takeoff and the rate of acceleration. By then, the turkeys were flying low and slow.\nIt was during that time, when I was six years old, that I caught the measles. I had a high fever, and my mother was worried\nabout me.\nEven the ornithologists stayed away — but not out of fear of the measles or respect for a household with sickness.\nThe fact was, they had discovered a wild turkey nest.\nAccording to the formula, the hen was pure-strain wild — not a little bit of the sluggish domestic bird in her blood — and the\nornithologists were camping in the woods, protecting her nest from predators and taking pictures.\nOne night our phone rang. It was one of the ornithologists. “Does your little girl still have measles?” he asked.\n“Yes”, said my mother. “She’s very sick.

The 36-year-old decided at the end of last year that getting rid of her handset would improve her mental health. So, over\nChristmas she told her family and friends that she was switching to an old Nokia phone that could only make and receive calls and\ntext messages.\nShe recalls that one of the pivotal moments that led to her decision was a day at the park with her two boys, aged six and three:\n“I was on my mobile at a playground with the kids and I looked up and every single parent — there was up to 20 — were looking\nat their phones, just scrolling away,” she says.\n“I thought ‘when did this happen?’. Everyone is missing out on real life. I don’t think you get to your death bed and think you\nshould have spent more time on Twitter, or reading articles online.”\nMs Cowling, who is a creative director at London-based advertising agency Hell Yeah!, adds that the idea to abandon her\nsmartphone had built up during the covid-19 lockdowns.\n“I thought about how much of my life is spent looking at the phone and what else could I do. Being constantly connected to lots\nof services creates a lot of distractions, and is a lot for the brain to process.”\nShe plans to use the time gained from quitting her smartphone to read and sleep more.\nAbout nine out of 10 people in the UK now own a smartphone, a figure broadly replicated across the developed world.

The 36-year-old decided at the end of last year that getting rid of her handset would improve her mental health. So, over\nChristmas she told her family and friends that she was switching to an old Nokia phone that could only make and receive calls and\ntext messages.\nShe recalls that one of the pivotal moments that led to her decision was a day at the park with her two boys, aged six and three:\n“I was on my mobile at a playground with the kids and I looked up and every single parent — there was up to 20 — were looking\nat their phones, just scrolling away,” she says.\n“I thought ‘when did this happen?’. Everyone is missing out on real life. I don’t think you get to your death bed and think you\nshould have spent more time on Twitter, or reading articles online.”\nMs Cowling, who is a creative director at London-based advertising agency Hell Yeah!, adds that the idea to abandon her\nsmartphone had built up during the covid-19 lockdowns.\n“I thought about how much of my life is spent looking at the phone and what else could I do. Being constantly connected to lots\nof services creates a lot of distractions, and is a lot for the brain to process.”\nShe plans to use the time gained from quitting her smartphone to read and sleep more.\nAbout nine out of 10 people in the UK now own a smartphone, a figure broadly replicated across the developed world. And we are\nglued to them — one recent study found that the average person spends 4.8 hours a day on their handset.\nYet for a small, but growing number of people, enough is enough.\nAlex Dunedin binned his smartphone two years ago. “Culturally we have become addicted to these tools,” says the educational\nresearcher and technology expert. “They are blunting cognition and impeding productivity.”\nHe has become happier and more productive since he stopped using a smartphone, he says.\nMr Dunedin doesn’t even have an old-fashioned mobile phone or even a landline anymore.

The document\nacknowledged the contribution made by the then princess and empress-to-be to ensuring her husband’s permanence in Brazil,\nwhich they believed was a key factor in gaining independence from Portugal. “Far more than just a letter, it is a political\nmanifesto,” notes historian Maria de Lourdes Viana Lyra. “At that time, in Brazil, women were given a subordinate role restricted\nto private household and family affairs. Outside the domestic sphere, women were made invisible, but that did not stop them from\nmobilizing politically to fight for independence in a variety of ways,” she states.\nIn addition to isolated actions led by famous figures, there were other many significant actions that are still largely unknown to\nthe general public, more specifically, those related to instances of collective mobilization of women active in the public arena\nduring the fight for Brazilian independence. Historian Andréa Slemian expands on the matter. “Throughout this process, many\nwomen expressed themselves through letters, manifestos, and other texts. Thus, the nascent press in Brazil played an important\nrole, not only by publishing these women’s ideas regarding independence on editorial pages, for example, but also by serving as a\nmouthpiece for views supporting women’s rights,” notes Slemian.\nAna Paula Orlandi.

The document\nacknowledged the contribution made by the then princess and empress-to-be to ensuring her husband’s permanence in Brazil,\nwhich they believed was a key factor in gaining independence from Portugal. “Far more than just a letter, it is a political\nmanifesto,” notes historian Maria de Lourdes Viana Lyra. “At that time, in Brazil, women were given a subordinate role restricted\nto private household and family affairs. Outside the domestic sphere, women were made invisible, but that did not stop them from\nmobilizing politically to fight for independence in a variety of ways,” she states.\nIn addition to isolated actions led by famous figures, there were other many significant actions that are still largely unknown to\nthe general public, more specifically, those related to instances of collective mobilization of women active in the public arena\nduring the fight for Brazilian independence. Historian Andréa Slemian expands on the matter. “Throughout this process, many\nwomen expressed themselves through letters, manifestos, and other texts. Thus, the nascent press in Brazil played an important\nrole, not only by publishing these women’s ideas regarding independence on editorial pages, for example, but also by serving as a\nmouthpiece for views supporting women’s rights,” notes Slemian.\nAna Paula Orlandi.

        "comando": "The philosopher Jeremy Bentham was regarded as the founder of utilitarianism and a leading advocate of the separation of\nchurch and state, freedom of expression, and individual legal rights. Furthermore, the “panopticon” is a type of institutional\nbuilding that has long dominated Bentham’s legacy. As a work of architecture, the panopticon allows a watchman in a central\ntower to observe occupants of surrounding cells without the occupants knowing whether or not they are being watched. As a\nmetaphor, the panopticon was commandeered in the latter half of the 20th century as a way to trace the surveillance tendencies\nof disciplinarian societies. Is it still a useful way to think about surveillance today?\nThe French philosopher Michel Foucault used the idea of the panopticon as a way to illustrate the proclivity of disciplinary societies\nto subjugate its citizens. He describes the prisoner of a panopticon as being at the receiving end of asymmetrical surveillance: “He\nis seen, but he does not see.” As a consequence, the inmate polices himself for fear of punishment.\nThe parallels between the panopticon and surveillance cameras may be obvious, but what happens when you step into the world\nof digital surveillance and data capture? Unlike the panopticon, citizens don’t know they are being watched. Jake Goldenfein, from\nthe University of Melbourne, tells me it’s important to remember the corrective purposes of Bentham’s panopticon when\nconsidering it as a metaphor for modern surveillance. “The relevance of the panopticon as a metaphor begins to wither when we\nstart thinking about whether contemporary types of visuality are analogous to the central tower concept. For example, whether\nthis type of visuality is as asymmetrical, and being co-opted for the same political exercise.” In the panopticon the occupants are\nconstantly aware of the threat of being watched — this is the whole point — but state surveillance on the Internet is invisible;\nthere is no looming tower, no dead-eye lens staring at you every time you enter a URL. There may not be a central tower, but\nthere will be communicating sensors in our most intimate objects.\nInternet: <theguardian.com> (adapted).\nBased on the previous text, judge the following item.",

And what we bring to the table is incredibly important and it’s missing”, said Amina Mohammed, the\nUN deputy secretary general. “I think it’s why mostly our human development indices are so bad, why we have so many conflicts\nand we’re unable to come out of the conflicts.”\nSince her appointment in 2017, Mohammed has been a constant voice in pushing back against the under-representation of\nwomen in politics, diplomacy and even the UN general assembly. Her efforts have helped cast a spotlight on the fact that women\nremain relegated to the margins of power around the world; last year the global proportion of female lawmakers stood at 26.9%,\naccording to Switzerland’s Inter-Parliamentary Union.\nSpeaking to The Guardian, Mohammed said “flexing muscle and testosterone” often dominated at tables of power around the\nworld. “This win, win, win at all costs — I think that would change if women were at the table”, she said.\nShe acknowledged that the world had seen a handful of female leaders who had not used their position to advocate for greater\npeace or conflict resolution. “Fair point, we see women in power and they’re sometimes the image of men”, she said.
