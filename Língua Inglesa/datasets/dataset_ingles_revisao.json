(...) They would sing, as a chorus,\nto words which to many would seem unmeaning jargon, but which, nevertheless, were full of meaning to themselves. I have\nsometimes thought that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of\nslavery, than the reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject could do.\nI did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the\ncircle; so that I neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a tale of woe which was then altogether\nbeyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling\nover with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains. The\nhearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequently found myself in\ntears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs, even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an\nexpression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the\ndehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of\nslavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of\nslavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, and, on allowance-day, place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him,\nin silence, analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul, and if he is not thus impressed, it will only be\nbecause “there is no flesh in his obdurate heart.”\nFrederick Douglass.

It was the colour of an old football, and more or less the shape of\none, save for the sunken cheeks and a strand or two of coarse, dry hair, like the hair on a coconut. Orlando’s father, or perhaps\nhis grandfather, had struck it from the shoulders of a vast Pagan who had started up under the moon in the barbarian fields of\nAfrica; and now it swung, gently, perpetually, in the breeze which never ceased blowing through the attic rooms of the gigantic\nhouse of the lord who had slain him.\nOrlando’s fathers had ridden in fields of asphodel, and stony fields, and fields watered by strange rivers, and they had struck\nmany heads of many colours off many shoulders, and brought them back to hang from the rafters. So too would Orlando, he\nvowed. But since he was sixteen only, and too young to ride with them in Africa or France, he would steal away from his mother\nand the peacocks in the garden and go to his attic room and there lunge and plunge and slice the air with his blade. (…) His\nfathers had been noble since they had been at all. They came out of the northern mists wearing coronets on their heads. Were\nnot the bars of darkness in the room, and the yellow pools which chequered the floor, made by the sun falling through the stained\nglass of a vast coat of arms in the window? Orlando stood now in the midst of the yellow body of a heraldic leopard. When he put\nhis hand on the window-sill to push the window open, it was instantly coloured red, blue, and yellow like a butterfly’s wing. Thus,\nthose who like symbols, and have a turn for the deciphering of them, might observe that though the shapely legs, the handsome\nbody, and the well-set shoulders were all of them decorated with various tints of heraldic light, Orlando’s face, as he threw the\nwindow open, was lit solely by the sun itself. A more candid, sullen face it would be impossible to find. Happy the mother who\nbears, happier still the biographer who records the life of such a one! Never need she vex herself, nor he invokes the help of\nnovelist or poet. From deed to deed, from glory to glory, from office to office he must go, his scribe following after, till they reach\nwhatever seat it may be that is the height of their desire. Orlando, to look at, was cut out precisely for some such career. The red\nof the cheeks was covered with peach down; the down on the lips was only a little thicker than the down on the cheeks. The lips\nthemselves were short and slightly drawn back over teeth of an exquisite and almond whiteness. Nothing disturbed the arrowy\nnose in its short, tense flight; the hair was dark, the ears small, and fitted closely to the head. But, alas, that these catalogues of\nyouthful beauty cannot end without mentioning forehead and eyes. Alas, that people are seldom born devoid of all three; for\ndirectly we glance at Orlando standing by the window, we must admit that he had eyes like drenched violets, so large that the\nwater seemed to have brimmed in them and widened them; and a brow like the swelling of a marble dome pressed between the\ntwo blank medallions which were his temples. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, thus do we rhapsodize. Directly we glance\nat eyes and forehead, we have to admit a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good biographer to ignore.\nVirginia Woolf. Orlando – A biography, 1928 (adapted).\nIn reference to the content of the text, its vocabulary and syntactic structure, decide whether the following statement are right\n(C) or wrong (E).\nIn lines 2, 3 and 4, although with different syntactic functions, the word it refers to the same thing: “the head of an enemy which\nswung from the rafters”.\nCerto\nErrado",

In this\nregard, Englebert’s book suffers from four tendencies, the first two of which involve a dominant mode in current writing about\nAfrica, and the third and fourth of which reflect the constraints of academic publishing, particularly in the United States of\nAmerica. Current writing about Africa is characterised, firstly, by a remarkable tendency to generalise about the entire continent,\nwhich no author specialising in Asia, for example, would dare contemplate. This usually involves the extrapolation of a single\nempirical situation to the entire continent. In Englebert’s case, this clearly relates to his experience in the eastern Congo, which is\nmade to serve as an example for all of sub-Saharan Africa. This tendency is associated, secondly, with an intensive search for a\nsingle factor that would explain the plight of Africa, a conceptual master key that can unlock the puzzle of the “African exception”.\nEnglebert’s book is a typical example of this tendency to substitute historical explanations with a philosophy of history. He is not\nconcerned with the identification of contingent factors which, through their myriad combinations and mutual (correlated) causal\nprocesses, have led to the emergence of the current complex situation on the African continent. Instead, he claims that the entire\nsituation arose from a single historical moment — that of decolonisation — and evolved by necessity from this, and that this\nhistorical moment gave birth to a structure of post-coloniality, from which African states are fundamentally incapable of liberating\nthemselves (while non-African post-colonies apparently are capable). Here, the argument becomes outright theological: The\nsovereignty accorded by outside actors represents the “original sin” of African statehood. As a consequence, and keeping in line\nwith this theological mode of thinking, post-colonial Africa can be saved only by others.\nT. Bierschenk.

In those days, the Civil and\nDiplomatic Service entrance exams took place in three stages, by the end of which hundreds of unsuccessful candidates had been\nknocked out. Only a score or so survived the final stage to be admitted to the Foreign Office.\nMy induction course lasted about a month. Then, one morning, I was taken to the West and Central Africa Department, told that I\nwould be responsible for French-speaking African countries plus Liberia. And that was that. I was now, at the tender age of\ntwenty-two, a wet-behind-the-ears but fully functioning British diplomat.\nI was put unsparingly to the test in my first month. I was summoned to the office of the Minister of State, a genial politician called\nGeorge Thompson, who was about to receive an official visitor from the Central African Republic. I was there to interpret between\nEnglish and French. The usual pleasantries of a courtesy call were easy enough to translate. But, just as I was beginning to relax,\nthe official told Thompson that one of the main exports from his country was roselle. What on earth was roselle? With panic rising\nin my gorge, something made me blurt out “jute”. To my horror, there ensued a lively conversation in which Thompson said “jute”\nand the African minister said roselle.\nAfter the meeting, I raced back to my office and looked in my dictionary. Roselle was not there. I tried out the mystery word on a\nFrench friend, but he had not heard of it either. But the next day, he called back. What was a British minister doing, he asked,\ntalking to a politician from the Central African Republic about a plant that was used as a diuretic and food-colouring agent? My\nheart sank. I saw my career slipping beneath the waves before it had hardly begun. “Oh, and by the way,” he added, “it’s also\nused sometimes as a substitute for jute fibre — if that’s of any interest to you.”.\nChristopher Meyer.

        "comando": "Text II\nWhat do politically minded visitors to a zoo feel when they stand in front of the panda bear’s cage? The previously cute panda\nmay suddenly strike them as strange — there is an intuitive knowledge that this panda, constantly eating bamboo in front of a\ncheerful and amazed audience, is deeply charged with political agency.\nEstrangement from the familiar is the start of every theory. Unfortunately, it was only recently that political scientists have\nembarked on exploring diplomacy systematically as a conceptual phenomenon, generating one unquestionable axiom: that of\nrepresentation. As with any axiom, it is unprovable, but it is the taken-for-granted starting point for all further research: most\nscholars agree on the basic postulate that diplomacy is about people representing polities (most often a state) vis-à-vis another\npolity.\nOne should mention that the notion of political representation is a theoretical axiom applicable to all countries, but let us explore\nthe example given by the panda bear and, consequently, by China a little further.\nIt is often correctly perceived that the speech of an accredited Chinese ambassador is attributable to the Chinese government. It\nis “China” who spoke, not (just) the individual person. This is the basis of representation.

The previously cute panda\nmay suddenly strike them as strange — there is an intuitive knowledge that this panda, constantly eating bamboo in front of a\ncheerful and amazed audience, is deeply charged with political agency.\nEstrangement from the familiar is the start of every theory. Unfortunately, it was only recently that political scientists have\nembarked on exploring diplomacy systematically as a conceptual phenomenon, generating one unquestionable axiom: that of\nrepresentation. As with any axiom, it is unprovable, but it is the taken-for-granted starting point for all further research: most\nscholars agree on the basic postulate that diplomacy is about people representing polities (most often a state) vis-à-vis another\npolity.\nOne should mention that the notion of political representation is a theoretical axiom applicable to all countries, but let us explore\nthe example given by the panda bear and, consequently, by China a little further.\nIt is often correctly perceived that the speech of an accredited Chinese ambassador is attributable to the Chinese government. It\nis “China” who spoke, not (just) the individual person. This is the basis of representation. But what is often forgotten is how non-\nhuman material can represent polities — they are also diplomats, but mute.\nIt may sound ridiculous, if not provocative, to posit that the panda bear in the zoo is China. But this is merely an extension of the\nbasic premise of diplomatic theory. Why should only human individuals be able to represent a state?

        "comando": "Text V\nAges ago, I acquired two recordings that inspire a feeling of weirdness whenever I listen to them, or even think about them. Both\nare performances of the great Lerner and Loewe musical My Fair Lady in languages other than English. Each of them has a\nspecial twist of irony. At the core of the original story is how the coarse Cockney girl Liza Doolittle is as a challenge, taken in by\nthe insufferably smug but utterly enthralled professor Henry Higgins, and through painful exercises — “The rain in Spain falls\nmainly in the plain” — acquires such an impeccably upper-class Oxbridge way of speaking English that at her (and his) ultimate\ntest, a posh ball that she attends incognito, drifting among the cream of British society, the keenest linguistic sleuth in the land\ndances with this mysterious beauty and in the end declares her too good to be true, and hence not English elite at all, but\nHungarian!\nThe whole idea of de-anglicizing this story strikes me as really nutty — and yet there they are, those recordings on my shelf. And\nso, on what wet plains do those heavy, drenching rains mainly fall, in Mi Bella Dama? And in the Hungarian version, to what\nelite nationality is the too-good to-be-true unrecognized Cockney girl assigned? Of course, the truly strange part in both cases is\nthat the whole time she is speaking Spanish or Hungarian, the charade is maintained that she is actually speaking English, and,\nunlike most plays or movies where one language is made to pass for another, the linguistic medium here is not just an incidental\nfact, but the very crux of the entire plot. I suppose the suspension of disbelief involved is no more strained than our willingness to\naccept as “reality” a story that is occasionally interrupted by the actors’ breaking into lyrical song, and then, as suddenly as it\nstarted, the singing is over and apparent normalcy resumes on stage.\nDouglas R. Hofstadter. Le ton beau de Marot: in praise of the music of language.

He was thinking that it was too hot to be bothered with the arduous task of\nstalking prey through the bushes. Below him there were fat antelope grazing. But this hunter couldn't be bothered, so lazy was\nhe! He gazed at the herd, wishing that he could have the meat without the work, when suddenly he noticed a movement. It was\na female cheetah. She singled out an antelope who had foolishly wandered away from the rest. With great speed she came upon\nthe antelope and brought it down.\nThe hunter watched as the cheetah dragged her prize to some shade on the edge of the clearing. There three beautiful cheetah\ncubs were waiting for her. The lazy hunter was filled with envy. Then he had a wicked idea. He decided that he would steal one of\nthe cheetah cubs and train it to hunt for him.\nWhen the sun began to set, the cheetah left her cubs concealed in a bush and set off to the waterhole. Quickly the hunter went\nto the bushes where the cubs were hidden. He first chose one, then decided upon another, and then changed his mind again.\nFinally, he stole them all.\nWhen their mother returned half-an-hour later and found her babies gone, she was broken-hearted. The poor mother cheetah\ncried and cried until her tears made dark stains down her cheeks. She cried so loudly that she was heard by an old man who\ncame to see what the noise was all about.\nThe old man returned to the village and told the elders what has happened.

        "comando": "Text 5A5AAA\nComputer networks, whether LANs, MANs, or WANs, are constructed based on a topology. There are several topologies, such as\ntree, bus and ring, and the popular mesh and star.\nA mesh topology allows multiple access links between network elements, unlike other types of topologies. The multiplicity of\naccess links between network elements offers an advantage in network reliability because whenever one network element fails,\nthe network does not cease operations; it simply finds a bypass to the failed element and the network remains to function. Mesh\ntopology is most often applied in MAN networks.\nAnother very popular topology, especially in LAN network technologies, is a star topology. A star topology is characterized by a\ncentral prominent node that connects to every other element in the network. So all elements in the network are connected to a\ncentral element. Every network element in a star topology is pairwise connected in a point-to-point manner through the central\nelement, and communication between any pair of elements must go through this central element. The central element or node\ncan operate either in a broadcast fashion, in which case information from one element is broadcast to all connected elements, or\nit can transmit as a switching device in which the incoming data is transmitted only to one element, the nearest element en route\nto the destination. The biggest disadvantage to the star topology in networks is that the failure of the central element results in\nthe failure of the entire network.\nJoseph M. Kizza. Network topology. In: Computer network security. Chattanooga: Springer, 2005, p. 15-7 (adapted).\nIn the text 5A5AAA,\n“it” refers to “network element”.\nCerto\nErrado",

They then demand a\npayment before they will release the decryption key to free the system. This type of extortion has existed for decades, but in the\n2010s it exploded in popularity, with online gangs holding local governments, infrastructure and even hospitals hostage.\nRansomware is a collective problem—and solving it will require collaborative action from companies, the government and\ninternational partners.\nAs long as victims keep paying, hackers will keep profiting from this type of attack. But cybersecurity experts are divided on\nwhether the government should prohibit the paying of ransoms. Such a ban would disincentivize hackers, but it would also place\nsome organizations in a moral quandary. For, say, a hospital, unlocking the computer systems as quickly as possible could be a\nmatter of life or death for patients, and the fastest option may be to pay up.\nCollective action can help. If all organizations that fall victim to ransomware report their attacks, they will contribute to a trove of\nvaluable data, which can be used to strike back against attackers. For example, certain ransomware gangs may use the exact\nsame type of encryption in all their attacks. “White hat” hackers can and do study these trends, which allows them to retrieve and\npublish the decryption keys for specific types of ransomware.

        "comando": "During a ransomware hack, attackers infiltrate a target’s computer system and encrypt its data. They then demand a\npayment before they will release the decryption key to free the system. This type of extortion has existed for decades, but in the\n2010s it exploded in popularity, with online gangs holding local governments, infrastructure and even hospitals hostage.\nRansomware is a collective problem—and solving it will require collaborative action from companies, the government and\ninternational partners.\nAs long as victims keep paying, hackers will keep profiting from this type of attack. But cybersecurity experts are divided on\nwhether the government should prohibit the paying of ransoms. Such a ban would disincentivize hackers, but it would also place\nsome organizations in a moral quandary. For, say, a hospital, unlocking the computer systems as quickly as possible could be a\nmatter of life or death for patients, and the fastest option may be to pay up.\nCollective action can help. If all organizations that fall victim to ransomware report their attacks, they will contribute to a trove of\nvaluable data, which can be used to strike back against attackers. For example, certain ransomware gangs may use the exact\nsame type of encryption in all their attacks. “White hat” hackers can and do study these trends, which allows them to retrieve and\npublish the decryption keys for specific types of ransomware. Many companies, however, remain reluctant to admit they have\nexperienced a breach, wishing to avoid potential bad press. Overcoming that reluctance may require legislation, such as a bill\nintroduced in the Senate last year that would require companies to report having paid a ransom within 24 hours of the\ntransaction.\nInternet: <www.scientificamerican.com> (adapted).\nIn the second paragraph of the text,\nthe word “disincentivize” could be correctly replaced by deter without any change in the meaning of the sentence.\nCerto\nErrado",

        "comando": "Text V\nUrbanization is one of the defining trends of this century and a key driver of development. By 2050, around 70% of the world’s\npopulation will be living in cities and towns. Asia and Africa will collectively account for a significant majority of the urban growth\nrate, a development that reflects the growth of both ‘megacities’ and smaller urban settlements in both regions over the past\nthree decades. Today, cities produce around 80% of the global GDP and this importance is likely to continue. Cities also use 75%\nof global energy and are responsible for 70% of global carbon emissions. Accompanying the pace and extent of urbanization are a\nnumber of positive and negative trends — from increased economic opportunities and improvements in lives and livelihoods,\nthrough to the potential for greater urban-rural disparity, lower quality of life, and conflict. One thing is clear, cities across the\nworld play a critical role in driving sustainable development.\nHowever, cities today face numerous vulnerabilities and threats. Without proper planning, policies, and support, urbanization often\nleads to unnecessary risks and costs, preventing cities from reaching their full potential. Cases such as urban sprawls and the\nproliferation of informal settlements are increasing, and the communities who reside in such areas often suffer from the poor\nprovision of public services (or lack of) such as healthcare or waste management systems. As their population grows, cities also\nbecome more complex, making long-term planning and city management a challenge. Amongst the numerous challenges that\npolicymakers must tackle include those that are environmental, those pertaining to resource allocation, and even social challenges\nsuch as reducing intra-city inequalities.\nCities are providing a wide range of opportunities and possibilities for its citizens and, in order for them to be fully harnessed,\ncities should be built for and together with its citizens to fully unlock their potential. This includes taking into account the various\nneeds and aspirations of people, making sure that everyone can have equal and inclusive access to services and create urban\nspaces and environments to enhance livability.\nInternet: <www.undp.org> (adapted).\nBased on text V, judge whether the following statement are right (C) or wrong (E).\nIt can be inferred that the more urban expansions and proliferation of informal settlements are created, the more problems the\ncommunities nearby will face in terms of provision of public services.\nCerto\nErrado",
