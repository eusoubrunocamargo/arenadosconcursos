Originally created by co-founder Christina Colmer McHugh to help her daughter communicate feelings, Moodbeam aims to bridge the gap left by in-person interactions, giving employers a way to “check in” with staff working from home.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">One user of the Moodbeam wristband, the UK charity Brave Mind, has found it helpful. Trustee Paddy Burtt noted that an employee’s struggle with workload and disillusionment only came to light through the data, underscoring the device’s potential to surface unseen issues. With mental health issues like anxiety and depression costing the global economy approximately $ 1 trillion annually in lost productivity, tools like Moodbeam are gaining traction. Studies indicate a growing need for mental health support, especially as remote work and blurred work-life boundaries exacerbate stress.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Other companies are also exploring solutions. In San Francisco, Modern Health connects employees to mental health resources, including therapy and meditation, based on a brief questionnaire. Similarly, Microsoft has developed a “virtual commute” feature within Teams, prompting users to reflect on their day and their schedule tasks, and to meditate to help distinguish between work and personal time. As more people work remotely, these innovations aim to provide accessible support for mental resilience and emotional well-being.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\">Internet: &lt;bbc.com&gt; (adapted).</span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to the previous text, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Moodbeam has a two-button device to help managers understand whether their remote workers are feeling positive or negative emotions.</p>",

While researchers expect to see older children socialised to particular gender roles, they were shocked to see similar patterns of behaviour starting to emerge at such a young age. They fear it could have long-term implications for girls’ health, as girls are less physically active as they get older and are more likely than boys to have difficulties with their mental health.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe study also found that preschool-age child ren from a minority ethnic background play less outdoors than their white counterparts, and children in urban areas play less outdoors than those in rural areas. “The results highlight inequalities in play even in the youn gest age group, which may exacerbate existing inequalities in health,” the report concluded.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe research surveyed more than 1,100 parents and carers of children aged two, three and four.

And while it seems daunting, we’ve actually reached a point where the “quantum” part of quantum computing is the easiest bit — it’s the “computing” that is inherently complex. For those on the front lines of building powerful quantum computers, this means it’s no longer a physics challenge — it’s an engineering one.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nCompanies won’t need to know the ins and outs of quantum computers in order to leverage its unprecedented power — they’ll simply benefit from its ability to solve the problems that could never be solved on classical computers.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Internet: &lt;thequantuminsider.com&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Regarding the text, judge the follow item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The success of quantum computing companies will depend on the ability of their team of scientists to deal with daily complaints from final users.</p>",

However, as we enter the 21st century, agricultural research has more difficult and complex problems to solve.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The environmental consciousness of the general public is requiring us to modify farm management to protect water, air, and soil quality, while staying economically profitable. At the same time, market-based global competition in agricultural products is challenging economic viability of the traditional agricultural systems, and requires the development of new and dynamic production systems. Fortunately, the new electronic technologies can provide us a vast amount of real-time information about crop conditions and near-term weather via remote sensing by satellites or ground-based instruments and the Internet, that can be utilized to develop a whole new level of management. However, we need the means to capture and make sense of this vast amount of site-specific data.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our customers, the agricultural producers, are asking for a quicker transfer of research results in an integrated usable form for site-specific management. Such a request can only be met with system models, because system models are indeed the integration and quantification of current knowledge based on fundamental principles and laws. Models enhance understanding of data taken under certain conditions and help extrapolate their applications to other conditions and locations.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\">Lajpat R.

While the technology supports efficiency and expands access to information, it must be governed by strong ethical frameworks, particularly when it can shape global power relations through sensitive negotiations. Rather than embracing AI as a magic wand, it must be approached as a double-edged sword that is capable of assisting, but never replacing the unique human skills that diplomacy demands.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Anusha Guru. <strong>The Future of Diplomacy</strong>: AI’s Expanding </em></span></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Role in International Affairs.

But it’s important to get as much sleep as you can. Getting up early in the morning is no easy task for plenty of people. That’s why alarms are important — they ensure that you wake up at your desired time. However, nobody can deny how tempting it is to try and squeeze in a few more minutes of sleep.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAccording to a survey, about 57 percent of people snooze in the morning, which is defined as needing multiple alarms to wake up. If you set a single alarm and snooze it repeatedly or set several alarms at regular intervals until the time you absolutely need to get up, you are a snoozer. Waking up on the first alarm is commonly recommended, but does it really make a difference if you are woken up by one alarm compared to several ones?

One by one, these courses went massive, with enrollments topping 100.000 students each. Soon the media was calling these courses MOOCs, short for massive open online courses.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nSince then, more than 1.200 universities around the world have launched free online courses. In addition to the larger global MOOC platforms, many national governments around the world have launched their own country-specific MOOC platforms, including India, Italy, Israel, Mexico and Thailand.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAfter a decade of popularization, in 2021, over 220 million students had signed up for at least one course on one of these platforms, and 40 million did so in 2021 alone. MOOCs and MOOC platforms are still growing, even after the crazy “Year of the MOOC” prompted by the pandemic and travel restrictions.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAt Class Central, we try to catalog as many MOOCs as possible, and our listing currently includes more than 150.000 of them, from MOOC platforms and other online learning platforms. But due to limited resources, we cannot index every single one. If you’re looking for MOOCs from around the world, this list is our best attempt to catalog all different MOOC platforms that are out there.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Internet: &lt;https://classcentral.com&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Keeping in mind the ideas expressed above and the linguistic aspects of the text, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is correct to conclude from the text that the total number of students who signed up for the three free online courses offered by Stanford in 2011 was higher than 300.000.</p>",

The decline in advanced economies’ emissions was driven by a combination of strong renewables deployment, coal-to-gas switching, energy efficiency improvements and softer industrial production.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Internet: &lt;www.engineeringnews.co.za/&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to the text, judge the following statemens.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Without the impact of low hydropower output, global CO2 emissions from electricity generation would have decreased in 2023, making the overall rise in energy-related emissions significantly smaller.</p>",

In writing it I thought first and foremost of readers in their teens. But I have never believed that books for young people should differ from books for adults except for the fact that they must reckon with the most exacting class of critics, critics who are quick to detect and resent any trace of pretentious jargon or bogus sentiment. I know from experience that these are the vices which may render people suspicious of all writings. I have striven to use plain language even at the risk of sounding casual or unprofessional. I hope that no reader will attribute my decision to get along with a minimum of the art historian’s conventional terms to any desire on my part of ‘talking down’ to him. Apart from this decision, I have tried to follow a number of more specific self-imposed rules, such as limiting myself to real works of art and cutting out anything which might merely be interesting as a specimen of taste or fashion. This decision entailed a considerable sacrifice of literary effects. Praise is so much duller than criticism, and the inclusion of some amusing monstrosities might have offered some light relief. Thus, while I do not claim that all the works illustrated represent the highest standard of perfection, I did make an effort not to include anything which I considered to be without a peculiar merit of its own.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nA second rule also demanded a little self-denial. I vowed to resist any temptation to be original in my selection, lest the well-known masterpieces be crowded out by my own personal favourites. This book, after all, is not intended merely as an anthology of beautiful things; it is meant for those who look for bearings in a new field, and for them the familiar appearance of apparently ‘hackneyed’ examples may serve as welcome landmarks.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nOne more rule I have followed. When in doubt I have always preferred to discuss a work which I had seen in the original rather than one I knew only from photographs. I should have liked to make this an absolute rule, but I did not want the reader to be penalized by the accidents of travel restrictions which sometimes dog the life of the art-lover.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\">E.

It is this mutual awareness of the cross-effects of actions and the actions taken as a result of this awareness that constitute the most interesting aspects of strategy.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When each participant is significant in the interaction, either because each is a large player to start with or because commitments or private information narrow the scope of the relationship to a point where each is an important player <em>within</em> the relationship, we must think of the interaction as a strategic game. Such situations are the rule rather than the exception in business, in politics, and even in social interactions. Therefore, the study of strategic games forms an important part of all fields that analyze these matters.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Avinash Dixit et al. <strong>Games of strategy.</strong><br/>\nNew York: W.W.

The teaching of English consumes a considerable portion of available educational resources in many countries, and English is not necessarily a neutral product offering equal opportunities for all. English teachers, therefore, need to appreciate the special status English has in modern life, what its costs and benefits are to those who try to learn it, the different motivations learners may have for learning English and the different circumstances in which they learn it.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The English language has a complex status in today's world. For some people, it is acquired as a first language.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For some, it may be learned at school, and may be essential for academic and professional success. For others, it may represent a subject that they are required to study in school, but for which they have no immediate need. And English means different things to people in different parts of the world. For some, it may arouse positive feelings as the language of pop culture, the media and social networking. For others, it may have associations with colonialism, exploitation, elitism or social and economic inequality.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">English today has <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">a unique status,</span> as a consequence of the role it plays around the world and its function as an international or world language.

(...) They would sing, as a chorus, to words which to many would seem unmeaning jargon, but which, nevertheless, were full of meaning to themselves. I have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of slavery, <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">than the reading of whole volumes</span> of philosophy on the subject could do.<br/><br/>\n\tI did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle; so that I neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequently found myself in tears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs, even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an expression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that  conception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of slavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, and, on allowance-day, place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him, in silence, analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul, and if he is not thus impressed, it will only be because “there is no flesh in his obdurate heart.”<br/></p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><span style=\"\">Frederick Douglass. <strong>Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, an American slave</strong>.

The suppression of indigenous languages is intricately connected with mental health problems. Indigenous youth with less knowledge of their native language are six times more likely to have suicidal ideation than those with greater language knowledge. Language suppression impairs self-identity, wellbeing, self-esteem, and empowerment.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nJust as language extinction can affect mental health, so can reinstating a language. Aboriginal youth who are capable of speaking their native language are less likely to consume alcohol or use illicit substances at risky amounts, and are less likely to be exposed to violence. Moreover, knowledge of indigenous languages is associated with a decrease in youth suicide by 50% a year.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe digital recording of indigenous languages might be useful for documentation, restoration, promotion, and education. Sufficient fund allocation is required to recover and store the alphabets of indigenous languages. Separate indigenous language educational institutes, in which researchers and mental health professionals can work in cooperation, are also extremely necessary. These concerted efforts might help result in the renewal of a given indigenous language and potentially reduce mental health problems.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Omar Faruk and Simon Rosenbaum.</em></span></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em><strong>The mental health consequences of indigenous language loss.</strong> In<strong>: The Lancet Psychiatry</strong>.

Recipes use relatively predictable and restricted vocabulary that can be easily adjusted for language level. The grammar can also be limited to the imperative: “First chop the onions.

The interest is to be divided into five equal parts and distributed as follows: one part to the person who made the most important discovery or invention in the field of physics; one part to the person who made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who, in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction; and one part to the person who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses. The prizes for physics and chemistry are to be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical achievements by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm; and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be selected by the Norwegian Storting.

While AI can support decision-making, it may also manipulate human behavior subtly, especially through systems developed in countries with different geopolitical priorities. This deepens the AI divide between technologically advanced and resource-limited nations, embedding linguistic and cultural biases and reinforcing global power asymmetries. As algorithms take their place alongside diplomats, the art of negotiation now meets the science of AI. The future of diplomacy must lie in fostering a symbiotic relationship where AI enhances human expertise, streamlines processes, and offers new strategic tools while leaving the nuanced art of diplomacy in human hands.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/><span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">Diplomatic institutions adopting such technologies</span> should also adopt guardrails to clarify how these systems inform decision-making. To ensure that AI systems function appropriately across diverse cultural contexts, adaptive and responsible AI frameworks should be integrated into policy discussions at the national and international levels. Crucially, any AI deployment must prioritise human agency. The goal must not be to automate diplomacy, but to augment it. AI’s incorporation into diplomacy offers both promise and peril. While the technology supports efficiency and expands access to information, it must be governed by strong ethical frameworks, particularly when it can shape global power relations through sensitive negotiations. Rather than embracing AI as a magic wand, it must be approached as a double-edged sword that is capable of assisting, but never replacing the unique human skills that diplomacy demands.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Anusha Guru. <strong>The Future of Diplomacy</strong>: AI’s Expanding </em></span></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Role in International Affairs.

Apple’s Siri digital assistant unveiled a gender-neutral option last year, and when asked about their gender identities, the AI chatbots ChatGPT and Google Bard each reply, “I do not have a gender.”</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/><span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">There have been concerns</span> over gendering technology, since doing so reinforces societal stereotypes. That happens because the stereotypes commonly associated with men, such as competitiveness and dominance, are more valued than those associated with women. That is likely true, says Ashley Martin, a professor at Stanford University. “People are stereotyping their gendered objects in very traditional ways,” she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nRemoving gender from the picture altogether seems like a simple way to fix this. Yet, as Martin has found in her latest research, conducted with Malia Mason, of Columbia Universty, gender is one of the fundamental ways people form connections with objects, particularly those designed to evoke human characteristics.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThroughout the experiments, Martin and Mason found that gender increased users’ feelings of attachment to devices such as digital voice assistants –– and their interest in purchasing them. For example, participants said they would be less likely to buy a genderless voice assistant than versions with male or female voices.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em><strong>Hope Reese.

The suspected culprit was a piece of rogue space junk. While thankfully no astronauts were injured, it has re-focussed attention on the growing problem of orbital debris.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/><strong>How did we get here?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nIt’s easy to forget that just seven decades ago the Moon was the only thing orbiting the Earth. On 1 January 2021 there were 6,542 satellites in orbit. Tellingly, only just over half of them were active. That’s a lot of useless metal careering around the planet at 28,000 kph — ten times faster than a bullet.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/><strong>How bad is the problem?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nVery bad and getting worse. Estimates suggest there are currently half a million pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger and 100 million pieces of debris above one millimeter across. Yet only 27,000 pieces are actively tracked by the US Department of Defense.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/><strong>What is Kessler syndrome?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nIt’s a catastrophic chain of events in which a satellite is shattered by a piece of space junk (or a collision with another satellite) and the resulting debris destroys more satellites creating more junk and so on in a never-ending cascade. It’s a domino effect – one piece falls and then takes the rest with it – and is named after NASA scientist Donald Kessler, who outlined the dangers back in 1978.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/><strong>What can we do about it?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nBetter regulation of new launches would help, as right now it’s a bit of a free-for-all. There are existing regulations in place to try and mitigate the dangers, such as a 25-year de-orbit rule for missions in low-Earth orbit. However, ESA’s Space Debris Environment Report says that less than 60 per cent of those flying in low-Earth orbit currently stick to the rules.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\">Colin Stuart.

The purpose of such disclosure is to achieve accountability and inform citizens about governments’ financial decisions. Despite the efforts to improve the accessibility and readability of financial information, we do not know whether and how the financial information is processed by citizens. This study investigates how citizens assess the financial condition of governments when different financial information is presented. We conduct an online survey experiment to understand how disclosed financial information shapes citizens’ perceived level of a government’s fiscal stress and their attitudes toward governments’ revenue-raising strategies. We find that citizens prioritize the financial indicators that they are familiar with, such as debt and surplus ratios. While both historical and social reference points play an important role, social reference is more effective in influencing citizens’ perception. We only find limited evidence to support the relationship between citizens’ perception of fiscal stress and their support toward governments’ decisions to raise revenues.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em><span style=\"\">Internet: &lt;www.sciencedirect.com&gt; (adapted).</span></em></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Based on the text above and the vocabulary used in it, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In “State and local governments regularly disclose financial information” the verb “disclose” is close in meaning to<strong> make something known publicly</strong>.</p>",

It added that it now wants to help those whose languages aren’t represented in most technology. The new languages range from Bhojpuri, which is spoken in northern India, Nepal and Fiji, to Dhivehi, with its estimated 300,000 speakers in the Maldives.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe move now brings to 133 the total number of languages available on Google Translate as of May 2022. The company says the new languages also represent a technical milestone, <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">explaining</span> that they use a machine <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">learning</span> model which learns to translate into another language without ever <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">seeing</span> an example. This can be useful for languages where large datasets of human translations, which can be used to train a computer, are not available. But the company admits that the technology isn’t perfect.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nSo, will the translations be accurate? Some polyglots have noted problems with the languages already available. “For many supported languages, the translation is not great. It will definitely get the idea across but often it will lose much of the subtlety of the language,” Google Translate research scientist Isaac Caswell told the BBC.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nWith the new languages, he said, it would be no different. But the people who helped in the research said it was a good place to start. “My impression from other people I have talked to was that it was a very positive thing for them,” Mr Caswell said. In 2020, Google Translate added five new languages to the platform in what was then its first expansion in the past few years.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><em><span style=\"\">Internet: &lt;https://www.bbc.com&gt; (adapted).</span></em></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Based on the text above, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The words “explaining”, “learning” and “seeing”, in the second paragraph, are examples of verbs in the present continuous tense.</p>",

But this hunter couldn't be bothered, so lazy was he! He gazed at the herd, wishing that he could have the meat without the work, when suddenly he noticed a movement. It was a female cheetah.

Finally, he stole them all.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nWhen their mother returned half-an-hour later and found her babies gone, she was broken-hearted.

There are some things that good language learners do and some things they don’t do. Here are some of the most useful suggestions.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\t\t• Don’t be afraid of making mistakes. Good language learners notice their mistakes and learn from them.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\t\t• Do group activities. A good language learner always looks for opportunities to talk with other students.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\t\t• Make notes during every class. Look at your notes when you do your homework.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\t\t• Use a dictionary. Good language learners often use dictionaries to check the meaning of words they don’t know.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\t\t• Think in the language you’re learning outside the classroom. <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">When you’re shopping or walking down the street</span>, remember useful words and phrases.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\t\t• Do extra practice. Test and improve your language, reading and listening skills with self-study material. You can find a lot of this online.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\t\t• Imagine yourself speaking in the language.

General notions are abstract concepts such as existence, space, time, quantity, and quality. They are domains in which we use language to express thought and feeling. Within the general notion of space and time, for example, are the concepts of location, motion, dimension, speed, length of time, frequency, etc. “Specific notions” correspond more closely to what we have become <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">used to calling</span> “contexts”, or “situations”.

Just a few years ago such a statement would have been virtually unthinkable. For decades evidence from genetics seemed to support the theory that anatomically modern humans arose as a new species in a single locale in Africa and subsequently spread out from there, replacing archaic humans throughout the Old World without mating with them. But in recent years geneticists have determined that, contrary to that conventional view, anatomically modern <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\"><em>Homo sapiens</em> did in fact interbreed with archaic humans, </span>and that their DNA persists in people today.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The University of Arizona in Tucson examines the latest genetic finding and explores the possibility that DNA from these extinct relatives helped <em>H. sapiens</em> become the wildly successful species it is today.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I have an enduring interest in the rise of <em>H. sapiens</em> and I am fascinated with Neandertals. So naturally I’ve been keen to find out how much, if any, Neandertal DNA I have in my own genome. Several consumer genetic test companies now test for Neandertal genetic markers as part of the broader ancestry analysis, and, after one of them lowered the price of their kit to U$ 99 in December, I decided to take the plunge. As it happens, <em>National Geographic’s</em> Genographic Project had recently updated their own genetic test to look for Neandertal DNA, and they sent me a kit. And so it was on a chilly Saturday in late January that I found myself spitting into a test tube for a test company and swabbing my cheek for the Genographic Project.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course the two tests look at far more than one’s Neandertal ancestry. The company provides a wealth of health information, testing for variation in DNA that might affect disease risk and drug performance as well as mutations that could cause disease in one’s children. Genographic’s test does not look for health information. Both tests trace one’s maternal lineage (and paternal lineage, for males) to beyond 10,000 years ago and reveal what percentage of one’s recent ancestry comes from various regions around the world.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em><strong>Finding my inner neandertal.</strong> In: <strong>Scientific</strong><br/><strong>American,</strong> April, 2013, p. 5-7 (adapted).</em></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Judge the item that follow based on the text above.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The verb form “did” in the fragment “Homo sapiens did in fact interbreed with archaic humans” was used to express an indirect question.</p>",

Whereas worldwide temperatures have increased by an average of 1.1 ºC (1.9 ºF) since pre-industrial times, in Israel and the surrounding areas, average temperatures have risen by 1.5 ºC (2.7 ºF) between 1950 and 2017, with a forecasted increase of 4 ºC (7.2 ºF) by the end of the century. Meanwhile, rising sea levels — projected by Israel’s Environment Ministry to be as high as a meter by 2050, according to a new investigative report by <em>Haaretz</em> newspaper — threaten to obliterate Israel’s famed beaches, damage its desalination plants and undermine the sewage and drainage systems of many coastal cities. In the densely populated Gaza strip, where 2.1 million Palestinians are crammed into 365 square km (141 sq. mi.), sea level rise means a loss of precious real estate as well as saltwater intrusion into an already overtaxed aquifer.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nIn an arid region already threatened by desertification and declining precipitation, one would think that the looming climate catastrophe would catalyze a powerful climate movement. Instead, the whole thing is largely an afterthought. In Israel and the Palestinian territories the threat is both existential and more acute.

The document acknowledged the contribution made by the then princess and empress-to-be to ensuring her husband’s permanence in Brazil, which they believed was a key factor in gaining independence from Portugal. “Far more than just a letter, it is a political manifesto,” notes historian Maria de Lourdes Viana Lyra. “At that time, in Brazil, women were given a subordinate role restricted to private household and family affairs. Outside the domestic sphere, women were made invisible, but that did not stop them from mobilizing politically to fight for independence in a variety of ways,” she states.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to isolated actions led by famous figures, there were other many significant actions that are still largely unknown to the general public, more specifically, those related to instances of collective mobilization of women active in the public arena during the fight for Brazilian independence. Historian Andréa Slemian expands on the matter. “Throughout this process, many women expressed themselves through letters, manifestos, and other texts. Thus, the nascent press in Brazil played an important role, not only by publishing these women’s ideas regarding independence on editorial pages, for example, but also by serving as a mouthpiece for views supporting women’s rights,” notes Slemian.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Ana Paula Orlandi. <strong>Unafraid to fight.</strong> Internet:&lt;www.revistapesquisa.fapesp.br&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Considering the ideas and linguistic aspects of the text above, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the title of the letter alluded to in the first paragraph, the word “her” is used four times with the same meaning and could correctly be replaced by <strong>his</strong> in all four cases, had the letter been written to the Prince.</p>",

The fact that English has become the primary language for communication within international organizations such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the European Union is an example of such globalization. However, globalization has contributed as much to the “idea” of English as it has to its actual role in communication. In other words, in many parts of the world, English represents an image in popular imagination, established through the media, advertising and so on, rather than a practical necessity or reality for many people.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\tScholars and educationists differ in their attitudes towards the global spread of English.

Others see the spread of English as threatening local cultures, languages and identities. The phrase “linguistic imperialism” was used to explain how English has come to play a key role in maintaining the economic and political dominance of some societies over others. Because of the role of English as the dominant international language, the theory of linguistic imperialism asserts that other languages have been prevented from going through processes of development and expansion, and have been allocated a secondary status, along with the cultures they represent. Proponents of the theory of linguistic imperialism view the English language teaching industry as contributing to the propagation of the economic, cultural or religious values of dominant world powers.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Idem.

Among the most pressing concerns is the increasing frequency and intensity of droughts. Reduced rainfall diminishes pasture quality and availability, limiting feed for livestock and increasing water scarcity. This can lead to decreased animal growth rates, reduced milk production, and increased mortality rates. Moreover, prolonged droughts can contribute to desertification, shrinking available grazing land and forcing farmers to adopt costly alternative feeding strategies.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Beyond drought, other climate-related impacts include heat stress, which can significantly impact animal health and productivity. Rising temperatures can exacerbate heat stress, leading to decreased feed intake, reduced fertility, and increased mortality in livestock. Furthermore, extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall and flooding, can cause infrastructure damage, contaminate water sources, and lead to the loss of livestock.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The cattle farming sector itself contributes to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions, primarily methane produced during animal digestion and nitrous oxide from manure management.

The injunctions of morality, even when reinforced by the vision of the monotheistic higher religions, conflict with reason and self-interest. Man is divided against himself.

But it’s important to get as much sleep as you can. Getting up early in the morning is no easy task for plenty of people. That’s why alarms are important — they ensure that you wake up at your desired time. <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">However</span>, nobody can deny how tempting it is to try and squeeze in a few more minutes of sleep.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAccording to a survey, about 57 percent of people snooze in the morning, which is defined as needing multiple alarms to wake up. If you set a single alarm and snooze it repeatedly or set several alarms at regular intervals until the time you absolutely need to get up, you are a snoozer. Waking up on the first alarm is commonly recommended, but does it really make a difference if you are woken up by one alarm compared to several ones? In a recent sleep study, researchers examine how snoozing affects an individual’s health and sleep.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAccording to the study, people snooze for a variety of reasons. Most of the participants said that they just can’t get up with only the first alarm. Some say they snooze because they feel comfortable in bed, while others do it because they feel less tired when they do get up. A researcher said that snoozing might be a sign that people are waking up because of important scheduled activities — like school or work — rather than because they have adequately rested.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Internet: &lt;www.discovermagazine.com&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to the preceding text, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The adverb “However” (last sentence of the first paragraph), can be correctly replaced by Therefore, without changing the meaning of the text.</p>",

While some specialists consider ADHD a behavioral disorder, others call it a cognitive disorder.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe cause of ADHD is unknown. However, brain scans indicate that it may be caused by abnormal size, function, and form of the brain’s frontal lobe. There may also be an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. ADHD is believed to be inherited in most cases, but it is also prevalent in premature babies and children who have experienced head injuries.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe disorder ADD (attention deficit disorder) was renamed ADHD to account for the “hyperactivity” that is often one of the major symptoms found in people with the disorder. The <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">disability</span> can exist without the presence of hyperactivity, in which case it is referred to as a subset of ADHD called ADD. Both terms are often used to describe the same disorder.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nChildren can exhibit ADHD symptoms at a very young age, and are often diagnosed before the age of seven. On the other hand, some adults do not realize they have this disorder until their own children are diagnosed with it.

We can predict, however, that it will become clear that all social-economic-political issues intersect and that issues of technological advance are right in the middle of every intersection, sometimes causing the problems, more often offering possibilities for their solutions, and frequently providing opportunities for the world society to rise to new, higher levels of productivity, satisfaction, and happiness.<br/><br/>\nOf course, trying to predict the future with perfection is not defensible. But if we are active in some field, we are bound to be aware of important trends in it, and we should take our anticipations of significant future events seriously. We should force ourselves to list potential developments regularly, estimating for each the probability of its occurrence and the importance of the event should it occur.

The document acknowledged the contribution made by the then princess and empress-to-be to ensuring her husband’s permanence in Brazil, which they believed was a key factor in gaining independence from Portugal. “Far more than just a letter, it is a political manifesto,” notes historian Maria de Lourdes Viana Lyra. “At that time, in Brazil, women were given a subordinate role restricted to private household and family affairs. Outside the domestic sphere, women were made invisible, but that did not stop them from mobilizing politically to fight for independence in a variety of ways,” she states.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to isolated actions led by famous figures, there were other many significant actions that are still largely unknown to the general public, more specifically, those related to instances of collective mobilization of women active in the public arena during the fight for Brazilian independence.

Should it be in indigenous African languages or should it include Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Afrikaans, and so on? You cannot cram African literature into a small, neat definition.

However, this status was strongly rejected by many emerging countries because it gave pharmaceutical and seed companies (mostly from rich countries) free access to their genetic resources without being required in any way to redistribute a share of their profits.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThese countries scored a victory with the signing of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1992 and the TRIPS agreement in 1995. Genetic resources now come under the control of sovereign countries, and some property rights can be recognized to the indigenous communities on the resources that they have been conserving from generation to generation. States are now required to organize these “collective intellectual property rights” in such a way that any local resource conserved in this manner will generate dividends for these populations when used by multinational firms.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe now well-known concept of Access to Genetic Resources and Benefit-Sharing (ABS) emerged in the second half of the 1990s. Their aim was to organize a biological diversity marketplace capable of enhancing the value of the genetic resources of countries of the South, which cannot refuse access to these resources. In addition, these countries can now claim a share of the profits that may result from their use.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nIn short, the change in the status of genetic resources fromcommon heritage of mankind to a good that can be owned under national sovereignty took place in the early 1990s at the request of countries of the South and to their benefit, and the ABS mechanism is a fine example of intellectual property rights set up in the interest of the people of these countries.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nIn a general sense, this analysis is fairly accurate and could constitute an argument to be used against those who are of the opinion that the spread of intellectual property rights is an obstacle to the development of the South. <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">However,</span> the issue today is whether the South gained anything by playing this card.

This began to change significantly in the late 1980s with the growth and development of both (physical) IT and the (social) debate surrounding it. In a broad sense, sociologists of technology are concerned with explaining how social processes, actions and structures relate to technology; and in this are concerned with developing critiques of notions of technological determinism. The theories and concepts which have been developed are increasingly recognised as of value to<br/>\ntechnologists, notably in the area of information system design.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nTechnological determinism is the notion that technological development is autonomous of society; it shapes society, but is not reciprocally influenced. Rather, it exists outside society, but at the same time influences social change. In more extreme varieties of technological determinism, the technology is seen as the most significant determinant of the nature of a society. What is remarkable about the notion of technological determinism is neither its theoretical sophistication nor its explanatory utility. It is important because it is “the single most influential theory of the relationship between technology and society”, according to MacKenzie and Wajcman (1985).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe reality, of course, is that technologies do not, in practice, follow some pre-determined course of development. Research and development decisions, for example, are significant determinants of the sorts of technologies which are developed. Also, although technologies clearly have impacts, the nature of these is not built into the technology, but varies from one culture to another, depending on a broad range of social, political and economic factors.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Hughie Mackay. <strong>Theorising the IT/Society Relationship</strong>.</em></span></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>In: HEAP, N. et al.

Their main task has been to protect society from terrorists and criminals. They are increasingly held to account in the press, parliaments and courts.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The intelligence revolution is partly the result of new technology. As recently as 1999, on becoming director of the American National Security Agency (NSA), Michael Hayden asked to send an e-mail to all staff. He was told: “We can’t actually do that.” The organization used computers to break codes rather than to surf the web as everyone else did. The NSA’s new facility in Utah, the first of several, now stores exabytes of data drawn from everyday communications. At Britain’s GCHQ, most code-breaking was done on paper until well into the 1980s.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The revolution has brought spying closer to ordinary people. After the attacks on America on September 11th 2001, counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency became the focus for the American intelligence agencies. Almost two-thirds of today’s intelligence personnel have been hired since 9/11. As the world has moved online, so the spooks have become involved in monitoring organized crime and paedophiles as well as terrorists.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In a not very remote past, spies sent coded messages using short-wave radios and dead letter boxes. Now the communications of the spooks’ new targets are mixed in with everyone else’s, shuttling between computers and smartphones that are identical to those on your desk and in your pocket. Counter-terrorism, in particular, is pre-emptive. Hence the security services have had to act as hunters of conspiracies rather than gatherers of evidence.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><strong>Western intelligence</strong> — Shaken and stirred.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\">In: <strong>The Economist</strong>, 12/11/2016 (adapted).</span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Based on text, judge the following item.</p><p>In line 14, the connector “Hence” introduces a logical conclusion.</p>",

The distinguishing characteristics of the NFS were its attention to functions as the organizing elements of English language curriculum, and its contrast with a structural syllabus in which sequenced grammatical structures served as the organizers.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Notions”, according to Van Ek and Alexander (1975), are both general and specific. General notions are abstract concepts such as existence, space, time, quantity, and quality. They are domains in which we use language to express thought and feeling. Within the general notion of space and time, for example, are the concepts of location, motion, dimension, speed, length of time, frequency, etc. “Specific notions” correspond more closely to what we have become used to calling “contexts”, or “situations”. Personal identification, for example, is a specific notion under which name, address, phone number, and other personal information are subsumed. Other specific notions include travel, health and welfare, education, shopping, services, and free time.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>H.

At other times, the artist has thought to improve upon nature, developing an alternative standard — an idealized form. Standards of beauty in and of themselves are by no means universal. The Classical Greeks were obsessed with their idea of beauty and fashioned mathematical formulas for rendering the human body in sculpture so that it would achieve a majesty and perfection unknown in nature. The sixteenth-century artist Leonardo da Vinci, in what is perhaps the most famous painting in the history of Western art, enchants generations of viewers with the eternal beauty and mysteriousness of the smiling <em>Mona Lisa.</em> But appreciation of the refined features of this Italian woman is tied to a Western concept of beauty. Elsewhere in the world, these features may seem unattractive or undesirable. <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">On the other hand, </span>the standard of beauty in some non-Western societies that hold body painting, tattooing, and adornment both beautiful and sacred may seem odd and unattractive to someone from the Western world.

This trend continues until 19.5 years in women and 21 in men. Then it reverses. At 55 we wake at about the time we woke before puberty. On average this is two hours earlier than adolescents.

People use language for purposeful communication and learning a new language involves learning how touse words, rules and knowledge about language and its use in order to communicate with speakers of the language.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/><span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">This understanding of language sees a language not simply as a body of knowledge</span> to be learnt but as a social practice in which to participate. Language is something that people do in their daily lives and something they use to express, create and interpret meanings and to establish and maintain social and interpersonal relationships. If language is a social practice of meaning-making and interpretation, then it is not enough for language learners just to know grammar and vocabulary. They also need to know how that language is used to create and represent meanings and how to communicate with others and to engage with the communication of others. This requires the development of awareness of the nature of language and its impact on the world.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>A. Scarino; A. J. Liddicoat<strong>.

It was a “great spiritual symbol,” of a time when “man had just emerged from a purely zoological existence, when instead of being dominated by animals, he began to dominate them.” But the child-like and highly stylized stick figures found in caves do not radiate triumph. By the standards of our own time, they are excessively self-effacing and, compared to the animals portrayed around them, pathetically weak.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nWhile twentieth-century archeologists tended to solemnize prehistoric art as “magico-religious” or “shamanic,” today’s more secular viewers sometimes detect a vein of sheer silliness. India’s Mesolithic rock art portrays few human stick figures; those that are portrayed have been described by modern viewers as “comical,” “animalized” and “grotesque.” As Judith Thurman wrote about the artists, “despite their penchant fornaturalism, rarely did they choose to depict human beings, and then did so with a crudeness that smacks of mockery.”</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nBut who are they mocking, other than themselves and, by extension, their distant descendants, ourselves? Of course, our reactions to Paleolithic art may bear no connection to the intentions or feelings of the artists. Yet there are reasons to believe that Paleolithic people had a sense of humor not all that dissimilar from our own.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\">Barbara Ehrenreich.

While some specialists consider ADHD a behavioral disorder, others call it a cognitive disorder.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe cause of ADHD is unknown. However, brain scans indicate that it may be caused by abnormal size, function, and form of the brain’s frontal lobe. There may also be an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. ADHD is believed to be inherited in most cases, but it is also prevalent in premature babies and children who have experienced head injuries.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe disorder ADD (attention deficit disorder) was renamed ADHD to account for the “hyperactivity” that is often one of the major symptoms found in people with the disorder. The disability can exist without the presence of hyperactivity, in which case it is referred to as a subset of ADHD called ADD. Both terms are often used to describe the same disorder.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nChildren can exhibit ADHD symptoms at a very young age, and are often diagnosed before the age of seven.

But from Bengal to Belize and Las Vegas to Lahore, the language of the sceptered isle is rapidly becoming the first global lingua franca.” Millennial retrospectives and prognostications continued in the same vein, with several major newspapers and magazines finding in the subject of the English language an apt symbol for the themes of globalization, diversification, progress and identity addressed in their special editions.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nA language achieves a genuinely global status when it develops a special role that is recognized in every country.

Seeing a reader gripped by digital Brontë made me aware that electronic books are giving literacy a new dimension. Many people like this new way of enjoying a book, and some may prefer it. Look at it this way: since the 1960s when transistor radios and — by the end of the decade — colour televisions transformed popular culture, every new technological advance has strengthened the appeal of the sort of media that rivals the book. Music and film, TV and video games: all have outshone books in technological glamour. Now, suddenly, here is a technological way to read a book. It’s kind of cool.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I don’t believe this technology will destroy the printed object; real books will never lose their charm.

My grandmother used to read all the time — in fact she was the village librarian — but you wouldn’t find many people in that same village today with the TV off, their heads in books.

The fact that <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">English</span> has become the primary language for communication within international organizations such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the European Union <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">is an example of such globalization.</span> However, globalization has contributed as much to the “idea” of English as it has to its actual role in communication. In other words, in many parts of the world, English represents an image in popular imagination, established through the media, advertising and so on, rather than a practical necessity or reality for many people.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Scholars and educationists differ in their attitudes towards the global spread of English. Some think this spread is natural, inevitable, neutral and beneficial, and have been accused of English triumphalism. The British linguist David Crystal suggests that English fosters cultural opportunity and promotes a climate of international intelligibility. Others see the spread of English as threatening local cultures, languages and identities. The phrase “linguistic imperialism” was used to explain how English has come to play a key role in maintaining the economic and political dominance of some societies over others. Because of the role of English as the dominant international language, the theory of linguistic imperialism asserts that other languages have been prevented from going through processes of development and expansion, and have been allocated a secondary status, along with the cultures they represent. Proponents of the theory of linguistic imperialism view the English language teaching industry as contributing to the propagation of the economic, cultural or religious values of dominant world powers.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Idem.

For the most part, these differences are traceable to the unique <span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">aspects</span> of the United States system, <span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">which</span> awards a patent to “[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.” The “first to invent” system requires more than the date of application to determine the owner of a disputed patent, which makes administration more difficult than the first-to-file system used almost everywhere else in the world. Another major difference between Brazil and the United States is who can apply for a patent. In the United States, the applicant for a patent must be the inventor, and only natural persons can be inventors, whereas in Brazil, both individuals and legal entities can invent and own patents.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Brazil also expressly prohibits patenting substances derived from living organisms and transgenic microorganisms that do not meet the three requirements of patentability: novelty, inventive activity and industrial application. Brazil further restricts the patenting of transgenic microorganisms to those that possess a characteristic not normally attainable by the species in natural conditions. Laws of nature, abstract ideas, physical phenomena, and naturally occurring substances are not patentable.

The document acknowledged the contribution made by the then princess and empress-to-be to ensuring her husband’s permanence in Brazil, <span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">which they believed was a key factor</span> in gaining independence from Portugal. “Far more than just a letter, it is a political manifesto,” notes historian Maria de Lourdes Viana Lyra. “At that time, in Brazil, women were given a subordinate role restricted to private household and family affairs. Outside the domestic sphere, women were made invisible, but that did not stop them from mobilizing politically to fight for independence in a variety of ways,” she states.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to isolated actions led by famous figures, there were other many significant actions that are still largely unknown to the general public, more specifically, those related to instances of collective mobilization of women active in the public arena during the fight for Brazilian independence. Historian Andréa Slemian expands on the matter. “Throughout this process, many women expressed themselves through letters, manifestos, and other texts. Thus, the nascent press in Brazil played an important role, not only by publishing these women’s ideas regarding independence on editorial pages, for example, but also by serving as a mouthpiece for views supporting women’s rights,” notes Slemian.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Ana Paula Orlandi. <strong>Unafraid to fight.</strong> Internet:&lt;www.revistapesquisa.fapesp.br&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Considering the ideas and linguistic aspects of the text above, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The passage “which they believed was a key factor” could be correctly rewritten in the passive voice as <strong>which was believed to be a key factor,</strong> without this changing the meaning and coherence of the text.</p>",

Despite this rather solemn title, there was something that we tried to do and failed — that was to define “African literature”. Was it literature produced in Africa or<em> about</em> Africa? Should it be in indigenous African languages or should it include Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Afrikaans, and so on? You cannot cram African literature into a small, neat definition. I do not see African literature as one unit but as a group of associated units — the sum of all the<em> national</em> and <em>ethnic</em> literatures of Africa. A national literature has a realized or potential audience throughout its territory. In other words, a literature that is written in the <em>national </em>language. An ethnic literature is available only to one ethnic group within the nation. <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">If</span> you take Nigeria as an example, the national literature, as I see it, is the literature written in English; and the ethnic literatures are in Hausa, Ibo, Yoruba, Efik, Edo, Ijaw, etc.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Chinua Achebe. <strong>The african writer and the english language.</strong></em></span></p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"\"><em>In: Patrick Williams &amp; Laura Cristman.<strong> Colonial discourse and postcolonial theory.</strong> New York: Columbia University Press, 1994, p. 428-9 (adapted).</em></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\tA respeito do vocabulário e dos aspectos linguísticos do texto 7A2-I, julgue o item seguinte.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\tIn the text, “If” introduces a conditional clause.</p>",

The process that started in 1807 prompted the separation and defined its most lasting results: the emergence of a Brazilian state and nation that would consolidate itself over the next century preserving its distinctive features. The independence process was strongly marked by progressive distancing between the past and the future. In this sense, the self-proclaimed revolutionary nature of the independence process fits neatly into the broader political and intellectual context of the time, full of conceptual innovations.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The continuity of Brazilian independence is, however, still the most common aspect highlighted by most historians and nonhistorians. It is true that the creation of the Empire of Brazil neither abolished slavery, nor upended social hierarchies for the vast majority of the population, nor modified the highly concentrated nature of land distribution and its overwhelming focus on sustaining an export economy built during centuries of Portuguese colonization. Yet, given the innovations involved in the creation of the Empire of Brazil and their significance in the first decades of the 19th century, the understanding of this history gains depth, complexity, and consistency if one replaces the simple and banal idea of <em>preservation</em> of slavery, social hierarchies, territoriality or monarchy with that of <em>re-creation</em><em> and reorganization</em> of these elements.

Changes in vegetation in drylands are predominantly caused by two factors: (i) anthropogenic climate change, which includes both changes in water availability driven by trends in precipitation and increases in temperature, as well as increased water use efficiency (carbon gain per unit of water lost) in response to rising atmospheric CO2; and (ii) land use practices, including grazing, cropping and deforestation. Unsustainable land use is considered the primary negative driver of dryland degradation. The impact of climate change on drylands is also generally thought to be negative, with some studies suggesting that anthropogenic forcing has already increased arid areas.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nDespite evidence for land use-induced degradation and the studies that find increased aridification over drylands, satellite estimates of <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">vegetation greenness</span> show a significant global increase since 1980. The key drivers of this global increase in apparent vegetation productivity are the vegetation’s response to rising CO2, increases in rainfall and temperature and land use. Model simulations which prescribe land use, attribute almost all of the trend in satellite-derived greening to CO2 fertilization, while satellite-derived models that do not account for CO2, explicitly find either climate or land use as the dominate factor. Neither approach explicitly accounts for rapid ecosystem change in their proportioning of the relative contributions of each driver. This can lead them to miss or underestimate rapid changes driven by processes like extreme fires, deforestation, reforestation, changes in agricultural policy, etc. Disentangling the roles of climate (temperature and precipitation), CO2 and land use thus remains a key challenge.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>A.L.

In 1800, there were indeed 550 steam engines in Europe but there were over 500,000 water mills. Coal was more expensive than hydro power and many industrialists were not persuaded of its added value. It was the economic recession of 1825-1848 with increasing agitation by textile workers over salaries and conditions which made the use of coal-powered, steam-driven spinning machines a much more attractive proposition. More machines meant fewer workers and fewer workers meant fewer demands, notably for wage rises. Therefore, the substantial increase in CO2 emissions in Britain in the first half of the nineteenth century, which through economic competition, war and imperial domination would start a worldwide trend, was not the blind outcome of the machinery of ‘progress’ but the cumulative consequence of a set of very specific decisions taken by identifiable socio-economic actors.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nSimilarly, the notion that ecological awareness is only a very recent phenomenon where “humanity” finally woke up to the environmental consequences of its economic activities does not <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">stand up to scrutiny</span>.

But most insects and, among birds specifically, hummingbirds are very small. The data that we can get from those measurements are limited.”</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nPenn State researchers used muscle anatomy literature, computational fluid dynamics simulation data and wing-skeletal movement information captured using micro-CT and X-ray methods to inform their model.

According tothe researchers, their approach is the first to integrate these disparate parts for biological fliers.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nWith this model, the researchers uncovered previously unknown principles of hummingbird wing actuation.

Without clean energy technologies, the global increase in CO2 emissions in the past five years would have been three times greater, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in one of its reports.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nEmissions increased by 410-million tons, or 1.1%, in 2023, compared with a 490-million-tonne increase in 2022, taking emissions to a record level of 37.4-billion tons. Specifically, an exceptional <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">shortfall</span> in hydropower owing to extreme droughts in China, the US and several other economies resulted in more than 40% of the <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">rise</span> in emissions in 2023, as countries turned largely to fossil fuel alternatives to plug the gap.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n“Had it not been for the unusually low hydropower output, global CO2 emissions from electricity generation would have declined in 2023 and made the overall rise in energy-related emissions significantly smaller,” the report pointed out. Additionally, advanced economies saw a record fall in their CO2 emissions in 2023 even as their gross domestic product (GDP) grew. Advanced economies’ emissions dropped to a 50-year low while coal demand fell back to levels not seen since the early 1900s. The decline in advanced economies’ emissions was driven by a combination of strong renewables deployment, coal-to-gas switching, energy efficiency improvements and softer industrial production.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Internet: &lt;www.engineeringnews.co.za/&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to the text, judge the following statemens.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe words ‘shortfall’ and ‘rise’ (in the 2nd paragraph) and ‘declined’ and ‘dropped’ (in the 3rd paragraph) convey the idea of a decrease or reduction in quantity or level.</p>",

Michael Housman, chief data science officer at RapportBoost.AI, explained that the ideal scenario for machine learning and artificial intelligence is something with fixed rules and a clear-cut measure of success or failure. He named chess as an obvious example. This happened faster than anyone anticipated because of the game’s very clear rules and limited set of moves. Housman elaborated, “Language is almost the opposite of that. There aren’t as clearly-cut and defined rules.”</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nI asked Dr. Jorge Majfud, Associate Professor of Spanish, at Jacksonville University, to explain why consistently accurate language translation has thus far eluded AI.

Similarly, idioms can be problematic for automated translations.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nDr. Majfud warned, “We should be aware of the fragility of their ‘interpretation.’ Because to translate is basically to interpret, not just an idea but a feeling. Human feelings and ideas that only humans can understand — and sometimes not even we, humans, understand other humans.” He noted that cultures, gender, and even age can pose barriers to this understanding and also contended that an over-reliance on technology is leading to our cultural and political decline.

When it was opened and read after his death, the will caused a lot of controversy both in Sweden and internationally, as Nobel had left much of his wealth for the establishment of a prize. His family opposed the establishment of the Nobel Prize, and the prize awarders he named refused to do what he had requested in his will. It was five years before the first Nobel Prize could be awarded in 1901.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nIn this excerpt of the will, Alfred Nobel dictates that his entire remaining estate should be used to endow “prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind”.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n“All of my remaining realisable assets are to be disbursed as follows: the capital, converted to safe securities by my executors, is to constitute a fund, the interest on which is to be distributed annually as prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind. The interest is to be divided into five equal parts and distributed as follows: one part to the person who made the most important discovery or invention in the field of physics; one part to the person who made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who, in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction; and one part to the person who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses. The prizes for physics and chemistry are to be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical achievements by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm; and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be selected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that when awarding the prizes, no consideration be given to nationality, but that the prize be awarded to the worthiest person, whether or not they are Scandinavian.”</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\">Alfred Nobel’s will.

The idea is to sell the clothes in Latin America. But only about 20,000 tons of the clothes leave Chile. What’s left in the Zona Franca de Iquique, or tax-free import zone, winds up piled up in illegal desert landfills or burned.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nClothing takes hundreds of years to biodegrade, if it ever does at all.

One recycling project, Ecofibra Chile, is working with importers to remove textile waste and transform it into thermal insulation panels. Other local groups are trying to get funds to address the problem of discarded clothing with heavy machinery to remove the clothes and recover public spaces, starting with areas closest to cities.

A newborn joey can’t suckle or swallow, so the kangaroo mom uses her muscles to pump milk down its throat. At around 4 months, the joey emerges from the pouch for short trips and to graze on grass and small shrubs.

This study investigates how citizens assess the financial condition of governments when different financial information is presented. We conduct an online survey experiment to understand how disclosed financial information shapes citizens’ perceived level of a government’s fiscal stress and their attitudes toward governments’ revenue-raising strategies. We find that citizens prioritize the financial indicators that they are familiar with, such as debt and surplus ratios. While both historical and social reference points play an important role, social reference is more effective in influencing citizens’ perception. We only find limited evidence to support the relationship between citizens’ perception of fiscal stress and their support toward governments’ decisions to raise revenues.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em><span style=\"\">Internet: &lt;www.sciencedirect.com&gt; (adapted).</span></em></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Based on the text above and the vocabulary used in it, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The word “Despite” (in the third sentence) is synonymous with <strong>In spite of.</strong></p>",

Likely, you’re reading this on your computer, smartphone, or tablet. Mining touches all our lives daily (in addition to metals used in electronics, think about that can of soda you are drinking, or the aggregate used to pave your driveway). The industry works hard to make sure the net impact is positive.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, the waste associated with mining, both past and present, is an unavoidable result of conventional mineral processing. In the future it may be possible to extract metals like copper and gold without crushing and grinding the ore down to fine particle size and adding considerable quantities of liquid, resulting in conventional tailings.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What are the challenges associated with conventional tailings? Well, it is all about water. Managing seepage from the tailings themselves, monitoring pore water pressure within the tailings dams or designing facilities to safely store or pass flood events. Because such a significant quantity of water is added during mineral processing, “conventional” tailings dams store the tailings as a slurry.

But from Bengal to Belize and Las Vegas to Lahore, the language of the sceptered isle is rapidly becoming the first global lingua franca.” Millennial retrospectives and prognostications continued in the same vein, with several major newspapers and magazines finding in the subject of the English language an apt symbol for the themes of globalization, diversification, progress and identity addressed in their special editions.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nA language achieves a genuinely global status when it develops a special role that is recognized in every country. To achieve such a status, a language has to be taken up by other countries around the world. They must decide to give it a special place within their communities, even though they may have few (or no) mother-tongue speakers.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nSalman Rushdie comments that “the English language ceased to be the sole possession of the English some time ago”. Indeed, when even the largest English-speaking nation, the USA, turns out to have only about 20 percent of the world’s English speakers, it is plain that no one can now claim sole ownership. This is probably the best way of defining a genuinely global language, in fact: that its usage is not restricted by countries or by governing bodies.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>David Crystal.<strong> English as a global language.</strong> Cambridge University Press, 2003. pp. 1-2;4;140-141 (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Judge the following item according to the text above.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In “A statement prominently displayed in the body of the associated article” (in the third sentence of the first paragraph), the expression “prominently displayed” means<strong> markedly exposed.</strong></p>",

Its birth can be traced back two decades before to the building of the world’s first under-river tunnel below the Thames, which swiftly became both popular with pedestrians and a huge tourist attraction.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nInitially, what would become the London Underground consisted of tracks dug slightly below the surface and then covered over, but as the technology improved, and trains switched from steam-powered to electric, the lines went deeper. Now the ground beneath Londoners’ feet hums with an extensive network of Tube lines ferrying people about the city speedily, efficiently — and out of sight.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAlong with trains, powerlines, pipes, and cables, there’s another piece of infrastructure some have long wished to bury — roads. To some, these thick asphalt ribbons crisscrossing countries and cleaving apart communities and ecosystems no longer seem fit for purpose. As they sprawl longer and wider in the hopes of speeding up traffic, congestion ticks upwards and cars continue to pollute the air and spew greenhouse gases.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nNo one has suggested burying every single one of the world’s roads. But what would happen if we did relocate them all below the surface?

The fallout from the cyberattack on the Texas-based software company appears to be vast, with a slew of powerful U.S. government agencies and businesses seemingly being infected by hackers who are believed to be affiliated with Russia.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nSolarWinds says it has identified 18,000 customers potentially affected by the incident, which saw the culprits hijack software updates for a widely-used IT monitoring tool called \"Orion\" to spread malware, seemingly with the intention of espionage. The consequences of the brazen cyber-assault, which was first discovered by security firm FireEye after it too was infiltrated by the same group, are yet to be understood. But experts fear the hackers' access could be exploited to steal sensitive information or destroy and falsify government data, and warn it could take years to fix.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nWhile the full list of victims is unclear — and expanding almost daily — Microsoft said its teams had identified more than 40 of its customers the attackers had aimed at \"more precisely and compromised through additional and sophisticated measures.\"</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/><span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">It now seems likely the scope of the victims could be broad</span>.

Right now, the industry needs to enable and push forward this ethical debate, recognizing its responsibility in this historic moment.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe first step is to end the myth of tech neutrality.

However, police scholars have criticized this popular understanding of the word “police” — that it refers to members of a public organization having the legal competence to maintain order and enforce the law — for two reasons.

In the earlier approaches, foreign language pronunciation was either the result of exposure to the target language or of approaches which used complex sets of drills and repetitions. As suggested, to a large extent, the importance of pronunciation has always been determined by ideology and intuition rather than by research. Teachers have intuitively decided which features have the greatest effect on clarity and which are learnable in a classroom setting. Saito claims that while the morphological and syntactical levels of languages are taught in contextualized meaningful exercises, pronunciation practice is decontextualized due to the use of drills and repetition.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Pronunciation is one of the aspects of language both native and non-native teachers of English are not <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">keen on</span> teaching, and a lack of adequate teacher training results in an intuitive use of available materials and techniques. Setting pedagogical goals must be based on knowledge of pronunciation issues. Unqualified teachers may have misconceptions about phonological phenomena, cannot evaluate or use teaching materials accurately, and do not set realistic goals when teaching pronunciation. Furthermore, even teaching materials do not reflect the conclusions of current research, and they can be perceived as boring; however, Baker argues that teachers who complete a pronunciation course have, and apply, a wider range of pronunciation activities in their classrooms.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>H.

But this hunter couldn't be bothered, so lazy was he! He gazed at the herd, wishing that he could have the meat without the work, when suddenly he noticed a movement. It was a female cheetah. She <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">singled out</span> an antelope who had foolishly wandered away from the rest. With great speed she came upon the antelope and brought it down.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe hunter watched as the cheetah dragged her prize to some shade on the edge of the clearing. There three beautiful cheetah cubs were waiting for her. The lazy hunter was filled with envy. Then he had a wicked idea. He decided that he would steal one of the cheetah cubs and train it to hunt for him.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nWhen the sun began to set, the cheetah left her cubs concealed in a bush and set off to the waterhole. Quickly the hunter went to the bushes where the cubs were hidden. He first chose one, then decided upon another, and then changed his mind again. Finally, he stole them all.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nWhen their mother returned half-an-hour later and found her babies gone, she was broken-hearted. The poor mother cheetah cried and cried until her tears made dark stains down her cheeks. She cried so loudly that she was heard by an old man who came to see what the noise was all about.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe old man returned to the village and told the elders what has happened.

Cognitive models, which are descriptive in nature, provide insight into the mental processes used by developers engaged in software development. The foundation of these mental processes are plans, stereotypic solutions to problems. Problem solving is the act of applying and tailoring plans to fit a new problem. Generalized and externalized plans are referred to as patterns.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\tSoftware methods provide a structure for mental processes by prescribing a specific set of processes and associated outcomes.

Structure defines the form and content of outcomes and supports the processes we use to create them. Process refers to the mental and physical activities we use to produce outcomes.

They were inconspicuous, cheap to establish and highly effective. Set up near and international summit buzzing with targets, or close to a place where drug-dealers peddle their wares, these facilities allowed their masters to monitor browsing habits, obtain targets’ logins and passwords, and plant spyware for future use. This was legal: consent was buried in the terms and conditions which users clicked on without reading. And in a neat twist, security-conscious people trying to avoid using their own computers favoured such places.

Most people readily trade private information for convenience. And hacking into computers can yield vast amounts of intelligence.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\t\tA lot of spying, however, has become trickier. It is much more difficult for intelligence officers to maintain secrecy and create fake identities.

It is “China” who spoke, not (just) the individual person. This is the basis of representation. But what is often forgotten is how non-human material can represent polities — they are also diplomats, but mute.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nIt may sound ridiculous, if not provocative, to<span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\"> posit</span> that the panda bear in the zoo is China. But this is merely an extension of the basic premise of diplomatic theory. Why should only human individuals be able to represent a state? In periods of conflict, flags (material objects) are burnt, walls are erected, monuments torn down; in times of better political mood, heads of states exchange precious gifts with each other, while embassy buildings in foreign countries enjoy a “sacred” legal status. Flags, walls, monuments, gifts, and the embassies re-present, i.e. “bring into presence,” a country, and actions toward these objects address the states they represent.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAnd there are good grounds for sensing a foreign policy tool in the giant pandas that now reside in zoos all over the world. They prominently embody China’s modern public diplomacy; they are non-human material deliberately deployed by the Chinese government to the soil of other states; and they have, at times, served as the primary means of expressing inter-state sentiment — during times of both conflict and cooperation —, in instances of the so-called “panda diplomacy”.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em> Andreas Pacher.<strong> The Diplomat.</strong> Nov./2017.

They made fine-grained knowledge of price movements available in close to real time to geographically dispersed market participants. Alex Preda conjectures, for instance, that the ticker helped prompt the rise of “chartism” or “technical analysis”: the belief — still widespread — that patterns can be found in price graphs that have predictive value. Actors’ equipment goes beyond physical technologies: their “conceptual equipment” also matters, or so the social studies of finance posit. Financial markets are complicated places. Given the limited memory and computational capacity of the human brain, economic agents must develop and acquire  systematic ways of making sense of markets. Organizations must develop procedures for interacting with markets, and to an increasing extent those procedures are implemented  in algorithms in automated pricing, trading and risk-management systems.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nSometimes, the ways of thinking, procedures, and algorithms that are employed derive from financial economics. Probably more often, however, practitioners’ ways of thinking and associated ways of acting have no direct connection to “academic” economics or indeed are regarded by economists as mistaken. Chartism is an example of the latter: financial economists regard it as <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">on a par with</span> astrology, but many traders take it seriously, and act on the basis of it.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n“Public facts”, such as the LIBOR1, technical equipment, graphical presentations, and “conceptual equipment” are all aspects of the diverse cognitive and calculative processes that take place in financial markets. These processes are “distributed” in the sense that a given task is often performed not by a single unaided human but by multiple human beings, objects, and technical systems. To understand cognition that involves multiple collaborating human beings and/or interaction with objects and technical systems, one must go beyond the psychological or cognitive science analysis of the individual “bounded by the skin”.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAs Hutchins puts it, “a group performing [a] cognitive task may have cognitive properties that differ from the cognitive properties of any individual”.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>LIBOR stands for London interbank offered rate. </em></span></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>The interest rate at which banks offer to lend funds (wholesale money) to one another in the international interbank market (source:<strong> Financial Times)</strong>.</em></span></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Donald MacKenzie. <strong>Material Markets</strong>.

A closer examination of the issue suggests that the only real jobs protected from complete overhaul by machines are creative ones — not only the arts, but also high-level jobs such as CEOs and managers in the financial and corporate worlds.

This new key concept within the basket of global heritage conventions is, however, pre-structured by different patrimonial forerunners. If we want to understand the complex nature of today’s heritage, we have to take into account that the cultural life of heritage bureaucracies is shaped by national traditions devoted to the interpretation of history in general. One of these national traditions is the protection of historical monuments that also shaped the semantic field of heritage.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nOne of the central characteristics of UNESCO’s heritage operations is the fact that the member states choosing to ratify a given convention have to translate the internationally binding legal instruments into concrete national heritage policy. UNESCO’s program addressing natural and tangible heritage could build on existing legal frameworks at national levels; the implementation of the new concept of intangible heritage required that new frameworks be established. In this context, it is not only important to ask how an internationally negotiated concept such as intangible heritage is implemented on a national level, but also how this implementation is brought into being in bureaucratic ways. From a cultural anthropological perspective, it is methodologically relevant to pursue the path of this unfolding implementation through concrete actors, taking in account what range of agency is <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">allotted to</span> them. Heritage interventions on international as well as national levels are realized by different institutional actors, such as ministries on a higher level and museums, for example, on a lower level; individual actors outside of or within different institutional settings may, depending on the political context, contribute as well.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>M.

The fact that English has become the primary language for communication within international organizations such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the European Union is an example of such globalization. However, globalization has contributed as much to the “idea” of English as it has to its actual role in communication. In other words, in many parts of the world, English represents an image in popular imagination, established through the media, advertising and so on, rather than a practical necessity or reality for many people.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Scholars and educationists differ in their attitudes towards the global spread of English. Some think this spread is natural, inevitable, neutral and beneficial, and have been accused of English triumphalism. The British linguist David Crystal suggests that English fosters cultural opportunity and promotes a climate of international intelligibility. Others see the spread of English as threatening local cultures, languages and identities. The phrase “linguistic imperialism” was used to explain how English has come to play a key role in maintaining the economic and political dominance of some societies over others. Because of the role of English as the dominant international language, the theory of linguistic imperialism asserts that other languages have been prevented from going through processes of development and expansion, and have been allocated a secondary status, along with the cultures they represent. Proponents of the theory of linguistic imperialism view the English language teaching industry as contributing to the propagation of the economic, cultural or religious values of dominant world powers.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Idem.

Nevertheless, many teachers have at least two major mistaken ideas about motivation that prevent them from using this concept with maximum effectiveness. One misconception is that some students are unmotivated. Strictly speaking, that is not an accurate statement. <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">As long as a student chooses goals</span> and expends a certain amount of effort to achieve them, he is, by definition, motivated. What teachers really mean is that students are not motivated to behave in the way teachers would like them to behave. The second misconception is that one person can directly motivate another.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This view is inaccurate because motivation comes from within a person. What you can do, with the help of the various motivation theories that teachers have developed, is create the circumstances that influence students to do what you want them to do.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many factors determine whether the students in your classes will be motivated or not motivated to learn. You should not be surprised to discover that no single theoretical interpretation of motivation explains all aspects of student interest or lack of it. Different theoretical interpretations do, however, shed light on why some students in a given learning situation are more likely to want to learn than others.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Furthermore, each theoretical interpretation can serve as the basis for the development of techniques for motivating students in the classroom.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Internet: &lt;https//college.cengage.com&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Judge the following item according to the ideas of the previous text and its linguistic aspects.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In “As long as a student chooses goals”, “as long as” means <strong>after a long time.</strong></p>",

The plot unfolds as follows: in the 1950s, Elisa is a cleaner at a military research laboratory, who happens also to be mute, which places her among other minorities without a say: there is her African-American colleague Zelda and her neighbour, the artist Giles, who is gay. The screenplay brings together the<br/>\ndisenfranchised to save a fellow outcast.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe amphibious monster kept captive at the lab doesn’t have a name, and his idea of a witty and humorous conversation is to roar in your face. But Elisa takes a shine to him. “When he looks at me, he doesn’t know what I lack or how I am incomplete.”</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nIn this film <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">watertight</span> ideas fight for space with <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">flawed</span> ones. It begins with a dream sequence in which Elisa’s apartment is submerged. When the scene is repeated later for real, causing only a minor leak in the house below, the rational mind has too many objections (the floor would collapse!) for the fantasy to survive. An amphibious humanoid with magic powers we can believe, but a flooded apartment that is as good as new one scene later doesn’t stand up. There are other discrepancies too — like the sophisticated CCTV system in 1962, or the creature’s ability to wipe away the bulletholes in his own body, sealing up the wounds, <em>ET</em>-style.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em><strong>Newstatesman, February 9th, 2018 (adapted)</strong></em></span></p></div><p>Based on the text above, judge the following items.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the text, the words “watertight” (l.14) and “flawed” (l.14) mean respectively incontestable and erroneous.</p>",

There is a murder and a fatal church-bell-related accident, but the afterlife in <strong>Coco </strong>is a warm and hectic place, more comical than creepy. The story happens during the Day of the Dead, when the border controls between life and death relax and the departed are allowed temporary passage to the land of the living. A boy named Miguel makes the trip in reverse, which is not to say that he dies, but rather that his living self, through one of several metaphysical <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">loopholes</span> that the movie explains, is transported into a fantastical world of specters and skeletons, who hold fabulous parties and raucous outdoor concerts.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nNearly as enchanting as that magical realm is the Mexican village of Santa Cecilia, Miguel’s hometown, where he is part of a prosperous clan of shoemakers. The cultural vibe of <strong>Coco </strong>is inclusive rather than exoticizing, pre-empting inevitable concerns about authenticity and appropriation with the mixture of charm and sensitivity that has become something of a 21st-century Disney hallmark. Here, the importance of family — the multigenerational household that sustains and constrains the hero — is both specific and universal. It’s what<br/>\nexplains the particular beats of Miguel’s story and what connects him to viewers regardless of background.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nHe shows a certain kinship with other well-known recent cartoon characters. A gifted musician in a family that forbids music, he is a bit like Remy, the “Ratatouille” rat whose kin were hostile to his artistic ambition, and like Mumble, the misfit penguin in “Happy Feet.” Miguel’s quest — a search for roots, lost ancestors and information that might explain who he is — resembles Dory’s journey in <strong>Finding Dory</strong>. The sidekicks who accompany him, animal and (formerly) human, are drawn from a familiar well of archetypes, and the final round of lesson-learning and reconciliation hits notes we have heard many times before.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em><strong>Internet: &lt;www nytimes com&gt; (adapted)</strong></em></span></p></div><p>Based on the text above, judge the items from <strong>21 </strong>through <strong>28</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The word “loopholes” (l.9) is synonymous with <strong>events</strong>.</p>",

General notions are abstract concepts such as existence, space, time, quantity, and quality. They are domains in which we use language to express thought and feeling. Within the general notion of space and time, for example, are the concepts of location, motion, dimension, speed, length of time, frequency, etc. “Specific notions” correspond more closely to what we have become used to calling “contexts”, or “situations”. Personal identification, for example, is a specific notion under which name, address, phone number, and other personal information are subsumed.

The distinguishing characteristics of the NFS were its attention to functions as the organizing elements of English language curriculum, and its contrast with a structural syllabus in which sequenced grammatical structures served as the organizers.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Notions”, according to Van Ek and Alexander (1975), are both general and specific. General notions are abstract concepts such as existence, space, time, quantity, and quality. They are domains in which we use language to express thought and feeling. Within the general notion of space and time, for example, are the concepts of location, motion, dimension, speed, length of time, frequency, etc. “Specific notions” correspond more closely to what we have become used to calling “contexts”, or “situations”. Personal identification, for example, is a specific notion under which name, address, phone number, and other personal information are <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">subsumed</span>.

In those days, the Civil and Diplomatic Service entrance exams took place in three stages, by the end of which hundreds of unsuccessful candidates had been knocked out. Only a score or so survived the final stage to be admitted to the Foreign Office.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\t\t\tMy induction course lasted about a month. Then, one morning, I was taken to the West and Central Africa Department, told that I would be responsible for French-speaking African countries plus Liberia. And that was that. I was now, at the tender age of twenty-two, a wet-behind-the-ears but fully functioning British diplomat.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\t\t\tI was put unsparingly to the test in my first month. I was summoned to the office of the Minister of State, a <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">genial </span>politician called George Thompson, who was about to receive an official visitor from the Central African Republic. I was there to interpret between English and French. The usual pleasantries of a courtesy call were easy enough to translate. But, just as I was beginning to relax, the official told Thompson that one of the main exports from his country was <em>roselle</em>. What on earth was <em>roselle</em>? With panic rising in my gorge, something made me blurt out “jute”. To my horror, there ensued a lively conversation in which Thompson said “jute” and the African minister said <em>roselle</em>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\t\t\tAfter the meeting, I raced back to my office and looked in my dictionary. <em>Roselle</em> was not there. I tried out the mystery word on a French friend, but he had not heard of it either. But the next day, he called back. What was a British minister doing, he asked, talking to a politician from the Central African Republic about a plant that was used as a diuretic and food-colouring agent? My heart sank. I saw my career slipping beneath the waves before it had hardly begun. “Oh, and by the way,” he added, “it’s also used sometimes as a substitute for jute fibre — if that’s of any interest to you.”.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><span style=\"\">Christopher Meyer.

In this regard, Englebert’s book suffers from four tendencies, the first two of which involve a dominant mode in current writing about Africa, and the third and fourth of which reflect the constraints of academic publishing, particularly in the United States of America. Current writing about Africa is characterised, firstly, by a remarkable tendency to generalise about the entire continent, which no author specialising in Asia, for example, would dare contemplate. This usually involves the extrapolation of a single empirical situation to the entire continent. In Englebert’s case, this clearly relates to his experience in the eastern Congo, which is made to serve as an example for all of sub-Saharan Africa. This tendency is associated, secondly, with an intensive search for a single factor that would explain the plight of Africa, a conceptual master key that can unlock the puzzle of the “African exception”. Englebert’s book is a typical example of this tendency to substitute historical explanations with a philosophy of history. He is not concerned with the identification of contingent factors which, through their <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">myriad</span> combinations and mutual (correlated) causal processes, have led to the emergence of the current complex situation on the African continent. Instead, he claims that the entire situation arose from a single historical moment — that of decolonisation — and evolved by necessity from this, and that this historical moment gave birth to a structure of post-coloniality, from which African states are fundamentally incapable of liberating themselves (while non-African post-colonies apparently are capable). Here, the argument becomes outright theological: The sovereignty accorded by outside actors represents the “original sin” of African statehood. As a consequence, and keeping in line with this theological mode of thinking, post-colonial Africa can be saved only by others.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em><span style=\"\">T. Bierschenk.

But 1616 also saw the passing of another great writer: Miguel de Cervantes y Saavedra, who we know best as the author of <strong>Don Quijote</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAs Shakespeare left an indelible mark on the English language, Spanish has been referred to as the language of Cervantes. This is due not just to the inventiveness of Cervantes’ writing, but also to its orality. To read <strong>Don Quijote</strong> is to engage deeply with the act of storytelling in many forms. Indeed, almost any given character becomes a storyteller, through writing or reciting, dialogue or monologue.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nWith his ear for the spoken word, it should come as no surprise that Cervantes tried his hand as a playwright as well as a novelist. Although he yearned for recognition as the former, his true fame came as the latter. <strong>Don Quijote</strong> was published in two parts, the first in 1605 to almost immediate acclaim, and its sequel in 1615, the same year Cervantes published his <strong>Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses</strong> (i.e. Eight comedies and eight dramatic interludes).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nApril 23, 1616, is given as the death date for both Shakespeare and Cervantes, but neither man died on that day. Spanish records from that time write down the date of death as the date of burial. So we know Cervantes was buried on April 23, which means he probably died on April 22. Shakespeare actually died 11 days after Cervantes — May 3 by the Gregorian calendar that Spain adopted in 1582, but April 23 on the Julian calendar that England used until 1752.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em><strong>Kathryn Swanton.

If we take art to mean such activities as building temples and houses, making pictures and sculptures, or weaving patterns, there is no people in all the world without art. If, on the other hand, we mean by art some kind of beautiful luxury, something to enjoy in museums and exhibitions or something special to use as a precious decoration in the best parlour, we must realize that this use of the word is a very recent development. We can best understand this difference if we think of architecture. There is scarcely any building in the world which was not erected for a particular purpose. Those who use these buildings as places of worship or entertainment, or as dwellings, judge them first and foremost by standards of utility. But apart from this, they may like or dislike the design or the proportions of the structure, and appreciate the efforts of the good architect to make it not only practical but right. In the past the attitude to paintings and statues was often similar. They were not thought of as mere works of art but as objects <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">which had a definite function</span>. </p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Similarly, we are not likely to understand the art of the past if we are quite ignorant of the aims it had to serve. The further we go back in history, the more definite but also the more strange are the aims which art was supposed to serve. The same applies if we leave towns and cities and go to the peasants or, better still, if we travel to the peoples whose ways of life still resemble the conditions in which our remote ancestors lived. Among them there is no difference between building and image-making as far as usefulness is concerned. Their huts are there to shelter them from rain, wind and sunshine and the spirits which produce them; images are made to protect them against other powers which are, to them, as real as the forces of nature. Pictures and statues, in other words, are used to work magic.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>E. H.

So what’s the point of asking for a tip? And where is it going?” are some of the questions customers ask. But tipping researchers claim this is a way for companies to put the responsibility of paying employees on the customer rather than increasing employee salaries themselves. Self-tipping is viewed by many customers as a way to guilt-trip the person into tipping on something when they typically wouldn’t.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nMany companies told the Journal that these tipping prompts are optional, and the extra gratuity is split between all employees.

Animal rights advocates want to distinguish animals from inanimate objects, as they are so often considered by exploitative industries and the law. The animal rights movement strives to make the public aware <span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">of the fact</span> that animals are sensitive, emotional, and intelligent beings who deserve dignity and respect. But first, it’s important to understand what the term “animal rights” really means.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Animal rights are moral principles grounded in the belief that non-human animals deserve the ability to live as they wish, without being subjected to the desires of human beings. At the core of animal rights is autonomy, which is another way of saying choice. In many countries, human rights are enshrined to protect certain freedoms, such as the right to expression, freedom from torture, and access to democracy. Of course, these choices are constrained depending on social locations like race, class, and gender, but generally speaking, human rights safeguard the basic tenets of what makes human lives worth living. Animal rights aim to do something similar, only for non-human animals.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Animal rights come into direct opposition with animal exploitation, which includes animals used by humans for a variety of reasons, be it for food, as experimental objects, or even pets. Animal rights can also be violated when it comes to human destruction of animal habitats. This negatively impacts the ability of animals to lead full lives of their choosing.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Internet: &lt;thehumaneleague.org &gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Considering the ideas and linguistic aspects of the text above, judge the item below.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The fragment “of the fact”, can be deleted without affecting the meaning or correctness of the original text.</p>",

In addition to the larger global MOOC platforms, many national governments around the world have launched their own country-specific MOOC platforms, including India, Italy, Israel, Mexico and Thailand.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAfter a decade of popularization, in 2021, over 220 million students had signed up for at least one course on one of these platforms, and 40 million did so in 2021 alone. MOOCs and MOOC platforms are still growing, even after the crazy “Year of the MOOC” prompted by the pandemic and travel restrictions.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAt Class Central, we try to catalog as many MOOCs as possible, and our listing currently includes more than 150.000 of them, from MOOC platforms and other online learning platforms. But due to limited resources, we cannot index every single one. If you’re looking for MOOCs from around the world, this list is our best attempt to catalog all different MOOC platforms that are out there.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Internet: &lt;https://classcentral.com&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Keeping in mind the ideas expressed above and the linguistic aspects of the text, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The phrase “short for massive open online courses” can be correctly replaced with <strong>which stands for massive open online courses.</strong></p>",

The United States Department of Agriculture gave Upside Foods and Good Meat the green light to start producing and selling their lab-grown, or cultivated, chicken products in the United States. It’s going to be a while before you can buy cell-based meat in stores, though you should be able to get a taste at a restaurant sooner.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nIn a nutshell, lab-grown meat — or cultivated or cell-based meat — is meat that is developed from animal cells and grown, with the help of nutrients like amino acids, in massive bioreactors. When the meat is ready, companies collect it from the bioreactors and move it along the processing line. For one thing, growing meat from cells means that people can eat meat without having to slaughter animals. Upside Foods explains that cells it gathers from a fertilized chicken egg are stored in its cell bank and can be used for at least ten years. Animal cells can come from animal biopsies or even feathers, among other sources.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nGood Meat announced a partnership with chef and restaurateur José Andrés to bring the item to a Washington restaurant. Good Meat may consider partnering with other restaurants or launching in retail, but a supermarket launch is way down the line. Upside Foods is planning to introduce its product at Bar Crenn, a San Francisco restaurant, but did not share a launch date yet. Eventually, the company plans to work with other restaurants and make its products available in supermarkets. For now, Upside Foods is holding a contest to allow curious customers to be among the first to try the product in the United States.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\">Internet: &lt;edition.cnn.com&gt; (adapted).</span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">According to the preceding text, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe expression “In a nutshell” (first sentence of the second paragraph) could be correctly replaced with <strong>Briefly</strong>, without harming the original meaning of the sentence.</p>",

It must also include ensuring that the budget is on a sustainable path. Otherwise, policymakers cannot have the lasting impact they hope for. This risk is especially high in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Record budget surpluses, driven largely by federal pandemic aid, empowered states to adopt historically large tax cuts and spending increases from 2021 to 2023.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nState leaders must be able to assess whether their decisions will be affordable over the long term or will jeopardize their ability to solve state problems or even sustain programs and services in the future. Unfortunately, the nature of state budget processes discourages such long-term thinking. State policymakers devote much of their time to developing, enacting, and implementing annual or biennial budgets, a prime opportunity to achieve immediate policy goals.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nOne key strategy for changing this short-term focus is for states to use long-term budget assessments and budget stress tests to regularly measure risks, anticipate potential shortfalls, and identify ways to address impending challenges. Long-term budget assessments project revenue and spending several years into the future, and stress tests estimate the size of temporary budget shortfalls that would result from recessions or other economic events and gauge whether states are prepared for these events.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\">Internet: &lt;https://www.pewtrusts.org&gt; (adapted).</span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Considering the ideas conveyed in the previous text, as well as its linguistic aspects, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nWithout harming the meaning and the correctness of the text, the word “ensuring” (second sentence of the text) could be correctly replaced with to make sure.</p>",

It was a “great spiritual symbol,” of a time when “man had just emerged from a purely zoological existence, when instead of being dominated by animals, he began to dominate them.” But the child-like and highly stylized stick figures found in caves do not radiate triumph. By the standards of our own time, they are excessively self-effacing and, compared to the animals portrayed around them, pathetically weak.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nWhile twentieth-century archeologists tended to solemnize prehistoric art as “magico-religious” or “shamanic,” today’s more secular viewers sometimes detect a vein of sheer silliness. India’s Mesolithic rock art portrays few human stick figures; those that are portrayed have been described by modern viewers as “comical,” “animalized” and “grotesque.” As Judith Thurman wrote about the artists, “despite their penchant fornaturalism, rarely did they choose to depict human beings, and then did so with a crudeness that smacks of mockery.”</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nBut who are they mocking, other than themselves and, by extension, their distant descendants, ourselves? Of course, our reactions to Paleolithic art may bear no connection to the intentions or feelings of the artists. Yet there are reasons to believe that Paleolithic people had a sense of humor not all that dissimilar from our own.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\">Barbara Ehrenreich.

This began to change significantly in the late 1980s with the growth and development of both (physical) IT and the (social) debate surrounding it. In a broad sense, sociologists of technology are concerned with explaining how social processes, actions and structures relate to technology; and in this are concerned with developing critiques of notions of technological determinism. The theories and concepts which have been developed are increasingly recognised as of value to<br/>\ntechnologists, notably in the area of information system design.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nTechnological determinism is the notion that technological development is autonomous of society; it shapes society, but is not reciprocally influenced. Rather, it exists outside society, but at the same time influences social change. In more extreme varieties of technological determinism, the technology is seen as the most significant determinant of the nature of a society. What is remarkable about the notion of technological determinism is neither its theoretical sophistication nor its explanatory utility. It is important because it is “the single most influential theory of the relationship between technology and society”, according to MacKenzie and Wajcman (1985).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe reality, of course, is that technologies do not, in practice, follow some pre-determined course of development. Research and development decisions, for example, are significant determinants of the sorts of technologies which are developed. Also, although technologies clearly have impacts, the nature of these is not built into the technology, but varies from one culture to another, depending on a broad range of social, political and economic factors.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Hughie Mackay. <strong>Theorising the IT/Society Relationship</strong>.</em></span></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>In: HEAP, N. et al.

Furthermore, the “panopticon” is a type of institutional building that has long dominated Bentham’s legacy. As a work of architecture, the panopticon allows a watchman in a central tower to observe occupants of surrounding cells without the occupants knowing whether or not they are being watched. As a metaphor, the panopticon was <span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">commandeered</span> in the latter half of the 20th century as a way to trace the surveillance tendencies of disciplinarian societies. Is it still a useful way to think about surveillance today?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The French philosopher Michel Foucault used the idea of the panopticon as a way to illustrate the proclivity of disciplinary societies to subjugate its citizens. He describes the prisoner of a panopticon as being at the receiving end of asymmetrical surveillance: “He is seen, but he does not see.” As a consequence, the inmate polices himself for fear of punishment.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The parallels between the panopticon and surveillance cameras may be obvious, but what happens when you step into the world of digital surveillance and data capture? Unlike the panopticon, citizens don’t know they are being watched. Jake Goldenfein, from the University of Melbourne, tells me it’s important to remember the corrective purposes of Bentham’s panopticon when considering it as a metaphor for modern surveillance. “The relevance of the panopticon as a metaphor begins to wither when we start thinking about whether contemporary types of visuality are analogous to the central tower concept. For example, whether this type of visuality is as asymmetrical, and being co-opted for the same political exercise.” In the panopticon the occupants are constantly aware of the threat of being watched — this is the whole point — but state surveillance on the Internet is invisible; there is no looming tower, no dead-eye lens staring at you every time you enter a URL. There may not be a central tower, but there will be communicating sensors in our most intimate objects.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Internet: &lt;theguardian.com&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Based on the previous text, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Although conveying different notions and images, the word<strong> adopted</strong> could replace the word “commandeered” without contradicting the main idea of the sentence in which it is used in the text.</p>",

The answer is somewhat complicated. Because the vocabulary of a language serves only the members of the society who speak it, the question to be asked should be: Is a particular vocabulary sufficient to serve the sociocultural needs of those who use the language? When put like this, it follows that the language associated with a relatively simple culture would have a smaller vocabulary than the language of a complex society. Why, for example, should the Inuit people (often known by the pejorative term “Eskimo”) have words for chlorofluoromethane, dune buggy, or tae kwon do when these substances, objects, and concepts <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">play no part in their culture?</span> By the same token, however, the language of a tribal society would have elaborate lexical domains for prominent aspects of the culture although these do not exist in complex societies. The Agta of the Philippines, for example, are reported to have no fewer than thirty-one verbs referring to types of fishing, while in Munich, the terminology for the local varieties of beer is quite extensive, according to strength, color, fizziness, aging, and clarity, the full list exceeding seventy terms.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nHowever, even though no language spoken today may be labeled primitive, this does not mean that all languages do all things in the same way, or are equally influential in the modern transnational world. The linguistic anthropologist Dell Hymes claims that languages are not functionally equivalent because the role of speech varies from one society to the next. According to Hymes, though all languages “are potentially equal and hence capable of adaptation to the needs of a complex industrial civilization”, only certain languages have actually done so (Hymes 1961:77). These languages are more successful than others not because they are structurally more advanced, but because they happen to be associated with societies in which language is the basis of literature, education, science, and commerce.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><em><span style=\"\">Zdenek SALZMANN, James M.

The process that started in 1807 prompted the separation and defined its most lasting results: the emergence of a Brazilian state and nation that would consolidate itself over the next century preserving its distinctive features. The independence process was strongly marked by progressive distancing between the past and the future. In this sense, the self-proclaimed revolutionary nature of the independence process fits neatly into <span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">the broader political and intellectual context of the time, full of conceptual innovations.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The continuity of Brazilian independence is, however, still the most common aspect highlighted by most historians and nonhistorians. It is true that the creation of the Empire of Brazil neither abolished slavery, nor upended social hierarchies for the vast majority of the population, nor modified the highly concentrated nature of land distribution and its overwhelming focus on sustaining an export economy built during centuries of Portuguese colonization. Yet, given the innovations involved in the creation of the Empire of Brazil and their significance in the first decades of the 19th century, the understanding of this history gains depth, complexity, and consistency if one replaces the simple and banal idea of <em>preservation</em> of slavery, social hierarchies, territoriality or monarchy with that of <em>re-creation</em><em> and reorganization</em> of these elements. If not seen in this light, the history of Brazilian independence silences an array of diverse voices and actors who had been growing increasingly accustomed to participating in politics since the end of the previous century.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>João Paulo Pimenta. <strong>Independence: Change and Continuity.</strong> In: Oxford Research </em></span></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Encyclopedia </em></span><span style=\"\"><em>of Latin American History.

The purpose of such disclosure is to achieve accountability and inform citizens about governments’ financial decisions. Despite the efforts to improve the accessibility and readability of financial information, we do not know whether and how the financial information is processed by citizens. This study investigates how citizens assess the financial condition of governments when different financial information is presented. We conduct an online survey experiment to understand how disclosed financial information shapes citizens’ perceived level of a government’s fiscal stress and their attitudes toward governments’ revenue-raising strategies. We find that citizens prioritize the financial indicators that they are familiar with, such as debt and surplus ratios. While both historical and social reference points play an important role, social reference is more effective in influencing citizens’ perception. We only find limited evidence to support the relationship between citizens’ perception of fiscal stress and their support toward governments’ decisions to raise revenues.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em><span style=\"\">Internet: &lt;www.sciencedirect.com&gt; (adapted).</span></em></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Based on the text above and the vocabulary used in it, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The noun “revenues” (at the end of the text) could be correctly replaced by<strong> renewals</strong> without any change in the meaning of the sentence.</p>",

This has led to people becoming “disconnected from the botanical world” of plants when understanding flora has become crucial to ecology. Even students starting masters’ degrees in biology lack a “basic” ability to identify plants, the new study claims.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nData from the Higher Education Statistics Agency of the United Kingdom reveals just one student graduated in plant science for every 185 who graduated in other life sciences between 2007 and 2019. The lack of botanical knowledge means people can’t identify invasive species and that ecological damage is being done as trees are planted in the wrong places and wildflower meadows are damaged.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nResearchers argue “nature literacy” must become a core skill for professionals from planners, engineers, architects, and educators as much as it does to farmers, foresters, and fishermen. Researchers at the University of Leeds, in England, say plant ecology — which studies the distribution and abundance of plants, the effect of the environment on them and how they interact with the environment — is also not taught well enough. “We ignore the opportunities presented to us by the botanical world at our own peril,” said lead study author and doctoral student Seb Stroud.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThis data is also corroborated by the Scottish government, which said there are not enough skilled people to implement “<span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">nature-based solutions</span>” to rising temperatures. The University of Leeds team also argued that people’s inability to identify plants could make the spread of invasive plants worse.

If you don’t have previous experience, good contacts, or a good degree from a well-known university, you may want to apply for a lower-level job first.

That may improve your chances of getting hired.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nOnce you have work experience, then you will be in a good position to ask for more money.

At the same time, natural gas, coal, wind and nuclear facilities in Texas have been knocked offline by the unthinkably low temperatures.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">“The extreme cold is causing the entire system to freeze up,” said Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “All sources of energy are underperforming in the extreme cold because they’re not designed to handle these unusual conditions.”</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The ripple effects are being felt around the nation as Texas’ prolific oil-and-gas industry stumbles.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It’s striking that these power outages are happening in a state with abundant energy resources. Texas produces more electricity than any other US state — generating almost twice as much as Florida, the next-closest, according to federal statistics.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Wind power is also booming in Texas, which produced about 28% of all the US wind-powered electricity in 2019, the EIA said. But the problem is that not only is Texas an energy superpower, it tends to be an above-average temperature state.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That means its infrastructure is ill-prepared for the cold spell currently wreaking havoc. And the consequences are being felt by millions.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Critics of renewable energy have pointed out that wind turbines have frozen or needed to be shut down due to the extreme weather.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nEven though other places with colder weather (like Iowa and Denmark) rely on wind for even larger shares of power, experts said the turbines in Texas were not winterized for the unexpected freeze.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But this is not just about wind turbines going down.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nNatural gas and coal-fired power plants need water to stay online.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nYet those water facilities froze in the cold temperatures and others lost access to the electricity they require to operate.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It’s too early to definitively say what went wrong in Texas and how to prevent similar outages. More information will need to be released by state authorities. Still, some experts say the criticism of wind power appears overdone already. “In terms of the blame game, the focus on wind is a red herring. It’s more of a political issue than what is causing the power problems on the grid,” said Dan Cohan, associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The energy crisis in Texas raises also questions about the nature of the state’s deregulated and decentralized electric grid. Unlike other states, Texas has made a conscious decision to isolate its grid from the rest of the country.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That means that when things are running smoothly, Texas can’t export excess power to neighboring states. And in the current crisis, it can’t import power either.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Internet: &lt;www.cnn.com&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p></div><p style=\"text-align: left;\">About ideas stated in the text above and the words used in it, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In “Natural gas and coal-fired power plants need water to stay online.

The tech industry is now in a challenging space: trapped between the increasing politicization of technology, the still superficial social debate around its impact and the slow adaptation of appropriate legislation. Right now, the industry needs to enable and push forward this ethical debate, recognizing its responsibility in this historic moment.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe first step is to end the myth of tech neutrality. We need to acknowledge that technology is caught between private economic interests and its social value. Some tech business models, for example, prioritize commodification of data or advertising revenue over the social value of their services — the sharing of knowledge, connecting people, etc.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe social impact of tech is deeper than we usually perceive and most of the time invisible to us.

The country’s central bank started testing a new electronic currency, which was named electronic Chinese yuan or eCNY, last year in four cities and have recently expanded those trials to bigger cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, according to government presentations. No other major power is as far along with a homegrown digital currency.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThe effort is one of several by central banks around the world to try new forms of digital money that can move faster and give even the most disadvantaged people access to online financial tools.

In one possibility that economists have discussed, a central bank could program its digital currency to slowly lose value so that consumers are encouraged to spend it immediately.

In the earlier approaches, foreign language pronunciation was either the result of exposure to the target language or of approaches which used complex sets of drills and repetitions. As suggested, to a large extent, the importance of pronunciation has always been determined by ideology and intuition rather than by research. Teachers have intuitively decided which features have the greatest effect on clarity and which are learnable in a classroom setting. Saito claims that while the morphological and syntactical levels of languages are taught in contextualized meaningful exercises, pronunciation practice is decontextualized due to the use of drills and repetition.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Pronunciation is one of the aspects of language both native and non-native teachers of English are not keen on teaching, and a lack of adequate teacher training results in an intuitive use of available materials and techniques.

In the past, drivers with residential routes received two printouts each morning: a 30-page document listing more than 1,000 customers they needed to visit that day, and a separate five- or six-page document listing customers with delinquent accounts. As drivers made stops, they had to compare the two lists to determine whether to pick up each customer’s containers. With more than 90 drivers in the field, <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">Daily Disposal needed a more efficient way to route trucks and document trash pickup</span>. So, the company invested in a custom mobile app called eMobile, Samsung Galaxy tablets with 10.1-inch screens and cellular service from Sprint. Rather than receiving stacks of paper each morning, drivers simply download the day’s route onto their tablets via the eMobile app. As they move along, the mounted tablets tell them exactly where to stop. When drivers arrive at customers’ homes, they push one of three buttons on the touchscreen: “done,” “not out” or “skip.” Daily Disposal’s entire fleet now has mounted tablets. All residential drivers are using the solution, and drivers who pick up from commercial and construction sites will begin using it soon. And the company is looking for other ways to automate operations. “What we’re doing may seem simple, but it’s huge for us,” says Todd Ottonello, vice president of the company. “This also helps with our efforts to go green.

Both are performances of the great Lerner and Loewe musical<strong> My Fair Lady</strong> in languages other than English. Each of them has a special twist of irony. At the core of the original story is how the coarse Cockney girl Liza Doolittle is as a challenge, taken in by the insufferably smug but utterly <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">enthralled</span> professor Henry Higgins, and through painful exercises — “The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain” — acquires such an impeccably upper-class Oxbridge way of speaking English that at her (and his) ultimate test, a posh ball that she attends incognito, drifting among the cream of British society, the keenest linguistic sleuth in the land dances with this mysterious beauty and in the end declares her too good to be true, and hence not English elite at all, <em>but Hungarian</em>!</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\tThe whole idea of de-anglicizing this story strikes me as really nutty — and yet there they are, those recordings on my shelf. And so, on what wet plains do those heavy, drenching rains mainly fall, in <strong>Mi Bella Dama?</strong> And in the Hungarian version, to what elite nationality is the too-good to-be-true unrecognized Cockney girl assigned? Of course, the truly strange part in both cases is that the whole time she is speaking Spanish or Hungarian, the charade is maintained that she is actually speaking English, and, unlike most plays or movies where one language is made to pass for another, the linguistic medium here is not just an incidental fact, but the very crux of the entire plot. I suppose the suspension of disbelief involved is no more strained than our willingness to accept as “reality” a story that is occasionally interrupted by the actors’ breaking into lyrical song, and then, as suddenly as  it started, the singing is over and apparent normalcy resumes o<em>n stage.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><br/><em><span style=\"\">Douglas R.

A closer examination of the issue suggests that the only real jobs protected from complete overhaul by machines are creative ones — not only the arts, but also high-level jobs such as CEOs and managers in the financial and corporate worlds. Meaning, to state the obvious, the current elite will have job security while blue-collar workers will be threatened by huge job losses due to machines.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCritical questions that must be answered are that one <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">undisputed</span> need for this revolution is a constant supply of electricity, without which we cannot have satellite communication to keep smart devices working, fibre connectivity and so on.

Changes in vegetation in drylands are predominantly caused by two factors: (i) anthropogenic climate change, which includes both changes in water availability driven by trends in precipitation and increases in temperature, as well as increased water use efficiency (carbon gain per unit of water lost) in response to rising atmospheric CO2; and (ii) land use practices, including grazing, cropping and deforestation. Unsustainable land use is considered the primary negative driver of dryland degradation. The impact of climate change on drylands is also generally thought to be negative, with some studies suggesting that anthropogenic forcing has already increased arid areas.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nDespite evidence for land use-induced degradation and the studies that find increased aridification over drylands, satellite estimates of vegetation greenness show a significant global increase since 1980. The key drivers of this global increase in apparent vegetation productivity are the vegetation’s response to rising CO2, increases in rainfall and temperature and land use. Model simulations which prescribe land use, attribute almost all of the trend in satellite-derived greening to CO2 fertilization, while satellite-derived models that do not account for CO2, explicitly find either climate or land use as the dominate factor. <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">Neither approach</span> explicitly accounts for rapid ecosystem change in their proportioning of the relative contributions of each driver. This can lead them to miss or underestimate rapid changes driven by processes like extreme fires, deforestation, reforestation, changes in agricultural policy, etc. Disentangling the roles of climate (temperature and precipitation), CO2 and land use thus remains a key challenge.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>A.L.

The 36-year-old decided at the end of last year that getting rid of her handset would improve her mental health. So, over Christmas she told her family and friends that she was switching to an old Nokia phone that could only make and receive calls and text messages.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nShe recalls that one of the pivotal moments that led to her decision was a day at the park with her two boys, aged six and three: “I was on my mobile at a playground with the kids and I looked up and every single parent — there was up to 20 — were looking at their phones, just scrolling away,” she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n“I thought ‘when did this happen?’. Everyone is missing out on real life. I don’t think you get to your death bed and think you should have spent more time on Twitter, or reading articles online.”</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nMs Cowling, who is a creative director at London-based advertising agency Hell Yeah!, adds that the idea to abandon her smartphone had built up during the covid-19 lockdowns.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n“I thought about how much of my life is spent looking at the phone and what else could I do. Being constantly connected to lots of services creates a lot of distractions, and is a lot for the brain to process.”</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nShe plans to use the time gained from quitting her smartphone to read and sleep more.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAbout nine out of 10 people in the UK now own a smartphone, a figure broadly replicated across the developed world.

This has led to people becoming “disconnected from the botanical world” of plants when understanding flora has become crucial to ecology. Even students starting masters’ degrees in biology lack a “basic” ability to identify plants, the new study claims.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nData from the Higher Education Statistics Agency of the United Kingdom reveals just one student graduated in plant science for every 185 who graduated in other life sciences between 2007 and 2019. The lack of botanical knowledge means people can’t identify invasive species and that ecological damage is being done as trees are planted in the wrong places and wildflower meadows are damaged.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nResearchers argue “nature literacy” must become a core skill for professionals from planners, engineers, architects, and educators as much as it does to farmers, foresters, and fishermen. Researchers at the University of Leeds, in England, say plant ecology — which studies the distribution and abundance of plants, the effect of the environment on them and how they interact with the environment — is also not taught well enough. “We ignore the opportunities presented to us by the botanical world at our own peril,” said lead study author and doctoral student Seb Stroud.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nThis data is also corroborated by the Scottish government, which said there are not enough skilled people to implement “nature-based solutions” to rising temperatures.

Texas produces more electricity than any other US state — generating almost twice as much as Florida, the next-closest, according to federal statistics.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Wind power is also booming in Texas, which produced about 28% of all the US wind-powered electricity in 2019, the EIA said. But the problem is that not only is Texas an energy superpower, it tends to be an above-average temperature state.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That means its infrastructure is ill-prepared for the cold spell currently wreaking havoc. And the consequences are being felt by millions.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Critics of renewable energy have pointed out that wind turbines have frozen or needed to be shut down due to the extreme weather.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nEven though other places with colder weather (like Iowa and Denmark) rely on wind for even larger shares of power, experts said the turbines in Texas were not winterized for the unexpected freeze.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But this is not just about wind turbines going down.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nNatural gas and coal-fired power plants need water to stay online.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nYet those water facilities froze in the cold temperatures and others lost access to the electricity they require to operate.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It’s too early to definitively say what went wrong in Texas and how to prevent similar outages. More information will need to be released by state authorities. Still, some experts say the criticism of wind power appears overdone already. “In terms of the blame game, the focus on wind is a red herring. It’s more of a political issue than what is causing the power problems on the grid,” said Dan Cohan, associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The energy crisis in Texas raises also questions about the nature of the state’s deregulated and decentralized electric grid. Unlike other states, Texas has made a conscious decision to isolate its grid from the rest of the country.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That means that when things are running smoothly, Texas can’t export excess power to neighboring states.

Recent studies have even suggested that some portions of the tropical landscape already may release more carbon than they store.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But the inhaling and exhaling of CO2 is just one way this damp jungle, the most species-rich on Earth, influences the global climate.

The previously cute panda may suddenly strike them as strange — there is an intuitive knowledge that this panda, constantly eating bamboo in front of a cheerful and amazed audience, is deeply charged with political agency.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\tEstrangement from the familiar is the start of every theory. Unfortunately, it was only recently that political scientists have embarked on exploring diplomacy systematically as a conceptual phenomenon, generating one unquestionable axiom: that of representation. As with any axiom, it is unprovable, but it is the taken-for-granted starting point for all further research: most scholars agree on the basic postulate that diplomacy is about people representing polities (most often a state) vis-à-vis another polity.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\tOne should mention that the notion of political representation is a theoretical axiom applicable to<em> all </em>countries, but let us explore the example given by the panda bear and, consequently, by China a little further.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\tIt is often correctly perceived that the speech of an accredited Chinese ambassador is attributable to the Chinese government. It is “China” who spoke, not (just) the individual person. This is the basis of representation. But what is often forgotten is how non-human material can represent polities — they are also diplomats, but mute.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\tIt may sound ridiculous, if not provocative, to posit that <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">the panda bear in the zoo is China</span>. <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">But this is merely an extension</span> of the basic premise of diplomatic theory. Why should only human individuals be able to represent a state? In periods of conflict, flags (material objects) are burnt, walls are erected, monuments torn down; in times of better political mood, heads of states exchange precious gifts with each other, while embassy buildings in foreign countries enjoy a “sacred” legal status. Flags, walls, monuments, gifts, and the embassies re-present, i.e. “bring into presence,” a country, and actions toward these objects address the states they represent.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\tAnd there are good grounds for sensing a foreign policy tool in the giant pandas that now reside in zoos all over the world. They prominently embody China’s modern public diplomacy; they are non-human material deliberately deployed by the Chinese government to the soil of other states; and they have, at times, served as the primary means of expressing inter-state sentiment — during times of both conflict and cooperation —, in instances of the so-called “panda diplomacy”.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em> Andreas Pacher.<strong> The Diplomat.</strong> Nov./2017.

In Canada, for example, more than 80 per cent of the population now inhabit urban centers. And for the first time in history, more than half the planet’s population lives in cities.

The central element or node can operate either in a broadcast fashion, in which case information from one element is broadcast to all connected elements, or it can transmit as a switching device in which the incoming data is transmitted only to one element, the nearest element en route to the destination.

The relevance of this tool is growing because organisations of all kinds now recognise the importance of environmental matters and accept that their environmental performance will be scrutinised by a wide range of interested parties. These parties will use environmental auditing to investigate, understand and identify actions which help improve existing human activities, with the aim of reducing their adverse effects on the environment. An environmental auditor is the professional who will, on behalf of these parties, study an organisation’s environmental effects in a systematic and documented manner and will produce an environmental audit report based on the data provided. There are many reasons for undertaking an environmental audit, which include issues such as environmental legislation and pressure from customers.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\t\t\t\tAs a matter of definition, the term “audit” has its origins in the financial sector. Auditing, in general, is a methodical examination of procedures and practices aimed at verifying whether they comply with legal requirements, internal policies and accepted practices. The expression “environmental auditing” is often used as a generic term covering a variety ofmanagement practices used to evaluate a company’s environmental performance. Strictly, it refers to checking systems and procedures against standards or regulations, as said before, but it is often used to cover the gathering and evaluation of any data with environmental relevance.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\t\t\t\tConsidering the terminology used in the area, environmental auditing should not be confused with environmental impact assessment, although both are environmental management tools and the difference between them has become blurred. The former is carried out when a development is already in place, and is used to check on existing practices, assessing the environmental effects of current activities. It is correct to say that it provides a “snap-shot” of looking at what is happening at that point in time in an organisation. The latter is an <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">anticipatory tool</span>, that is, <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">it takes place before an action is carried out</span>. It is therefore an attempt to predict the impact on the environment of a future action, and to provide this information to those who make the decision on whether the project should be authorised.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><br/><span style=\"\">Internet: &lt;www.soas.ac.uk&gt; (adapted).</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\t\t\t\tBased on the text, judge the following item.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\t\t\tIn the excerpt “it takes place before an action is carried out”, the pronoun “it” refers to “anticipatory tool”.</p>",

Orlando’s father, or perhaps his grandfather, had struck <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\"><strong>it</strong></span> from the shoulders of a vast Pagan who had started up under the moon in the barbarian fields of Africa; and now <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">it</span></strong> swung, gently, perpetually, in the breeze which never ceased blowing through the attic rooms of the gigantic house of the lord who had slain him.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOrlando’s fathers had ridden in fields of asphodel, and stony fields, and fields watered by strange rivers, and they had struck many heads of many colours off many shoulders, and brought them back to hang from the rafters. So too would Orlando, he vowed. But since he was sixteen only, and too young to ride with them in Africa or France, he would steal away from his mother and the peacocks in the garden and go to his attic room and there lunge and plunge and slice the air with his blade. (…) His fathers had been noble since they had been at all. They came out of the northern mists wearing coronets on their heads. Were not the bars of darkness in the room, and the yellow pools which chequered the floor, made by the sun falling through the stained glass of a vast coat of arms in the window? Orlando stood now in the midst of the yellow body of a heraldic leopard. When he put his hand on the window-sill to push the window open, it was instantly coloured red, blue, and yellow like a butterfly’s wing. Thus, those who like symbols, and have a turn for the deciphering of them, might observe that though the shapely legs, the handsome body, and the well-set shoulders were all of them decorated with various tints of heraldic light, Orlando’s face, as he threw the window open, was lit solely by the sun itself. A more candid, sullen face it would be impossible to find. Happy the mother who bears, happier still the biographer who records the life of such a one! Never need she vex herself, nor he invokes the help of novelist or poet. From deed to deed, from glory to glory, from office to office he must go, his scribe following after, till they reach whatever seat it may be that is the height of their desire. Orlando, to look at, was cut out precisely for some such career. The red of the cheeks was covered with peach down; the down on the lips was only a little thicker than the down on the cheeks. The lips themselves were short and slightly drawn back over teeth of an exquisite and almond whiteness. Nothing disturbed the arrowy nose in its short, tense flight; the hair was dark, the ears small, and fitted closely to the head. But, alas, that these catalogues of youthful beauty cannot end without mentioning forehead and eyes. Alas, that people are seldom born devoid of all three; for directly we glance at Orlando standing by the window, we must admit that he had eyes like drenched violets, so large that the water seemed to have brimmed in them and widened them; and a brow like the swelling of a marble dome pressed between the two blank medallions which were his temples. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, thus do we rhapsodize. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, we have to admit a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good biographer to ignore.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"\">Virginia Woolf. <strong>Orlando – A biography</strong>, 1928 (adapted). </span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn reference to the content of the text, its vocabulary and syntactic structure, decide whether the following statement are right (<strong>C</strong>) or wrong (<strong>E</strong>).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n\tIn lines 2, 3 and 4, although with different syntactic functions, the word <strong>it</strong> refers to the same thing: “the head of an enemy which swung from the rafters”.</p>",

And so it was on a chilly Saturday in late January that I found myself spitting into a test tube for a test company and swabbing my cheek for the Genographic Project.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course the two tests look at far more than one’s Neandertal ancestry. The company provides a wealth of health information, testing for variation in DNA that might affect disease risk and drug performance as well as mutations that could cause disease in one’s children. Genographic’s test does not look for health information. Both tests trace one’s maternal lineage (and paternal lineage, for males) to beyond 10,000 years ago and reveal what percentage of one’s recent ancestry comes from various regions around the world.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em><strong>Finding my inner neandertal.</strong> In: <strong>Scientific</strong><br/><strong>American,</strong> April, 2013, p. 5-7 (adapted).</em></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Judge the item that follow based on the text above.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">“that conventional view” refers to the theory that modern humans came from just one single place in Africa.</p>",

In just one decade, it has signed up some 1.3 billion people, half of whom log in on any given day and spend an average of 18 minutes per visit.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Facebook connects families across continents, friends across the years and people around the world.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And yet Facebook’s effects on its users may not be entirely benign. Some researchers suggest that the ability to connect does not necessarily make people any happier, and it could actually reduce the satisfaction they feel about their life.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Can it really be possible that Facebook makes you sad?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Until recently, few had studied this question and the little evidence that did exist actually hinted that the social network has a beneficial effect. In 2009, Sebastian Valenzuela and colleagues at the University of Texas at Austin measured how life satisfaction varied among over 2,500 students who used Facebook, and they found a small positive correlation.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Yet last summer, a team of psychologists from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and the University of Leuven in Belgium decided to drill a bit deeper by evaluating how life satisfaction changes over time with Facebook use.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">Ethan Kross and colleagues</span> questioned a group of people five times a day over two weeks about <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">their emotional state.</span> They asked questions such as “how do you feel right now?”, “how lonely do you feel right now?”, “how much have you used Facebook since we last asked?” and so on. This gave them a snapshot of each individual’s well-being and Facebook usage throughout the day.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The team found that Facebook use correlated with a low sense of well-being. “The more people used Facebook over two-weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time,” they said. “Rather than enhancing well-being, these findings suggest that Facebook may undermine it.”</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\"><em>Justin Mullins. <strong>Can Facebook make you sad?</strong> February 6,<br/>\n2014.

But, in fact, that lack of responsibility  is one of the important respects in which the press is different. Of course, the press must be responsible for its own standards and ethics. But it is not the job of journalists to run  things: they are literally without responsibility. They don’t have to respond to a party whip, make the compromises necessary in politics or answer to shareholders. They are not bound by the confidentiality agreements that bind others. They are careless of causing inconvenience or embarrassment. They do not have to win votes. They can write things — about the economy, say,  or the environment — which may need saying but which are unsayable by politicians.

But for years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has gotten complaints that people felt drowsy the morning after taking the medicine or its successors, and sometimes got into car accidents.<br/><br/>\n\tAfter laboratory studies and driving tests confirming the risks of drowsiness, the FDA said that women should be taking half as much of the medicine. The new recommendation applies to drugs containing the active ingredient zolpidem, by far the most widely used sleep aid. Using lower doses means less of the drug will remain in the blood in the morning hours, and will reduce the risk that people who use it will be impaired while driving.<br/><br/>\n\tThe announcement was focused on women because they take longer to metabolize the drug than men. An estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of women will have a level of zolpidem in their blood that could impair driving eight hours after taking the pill, while only about 3 percent of men do. Reports of aftereffects from sleeping pills have circulated for years, and some doctors questioned why the drug agency took so long to act. Mishaps with sleepy driving — and even strange acts of texting, eating or having sex in the night without any memory of it in the morning — have long been familiar to the medical community.<br/></p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><span style=\"\">Internet: &lt;www.nytimes.com&gt; (adapted).</span></em></p><br/>\nJudge the item according to the text above.<br/><br/>\nThe word “its” in the first paragraph refers to “complaints”.",

However, an oracle told the gods that the son of Thetis would be more magnificent than his father, and so the gods shunned her S because they did not want to suffer a similar fate to Chronos, whose son Zeus conquered.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nIt was decided that Thetis must marry a mortal, and Cheiron, the centaur, suggested that a student of his – Peleus – should marry her. She fled from him but was eventually captured and married to him. She had many children, and tried to make them immortal by dipping them in the Styx and then thrusting them into a fire. However, this killed all of them except her last-born, whose father saved him from the fire. The<br/>\nboy, Achilles, had only been dipped into the Styx, which succeeded in protecting him, but since his mother had held him by the heel, that part of him was not protected.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAccording to legend, Achilles’ escape from the fire was very narrow indeed, with his father pulling him out too late to save him from being burnt on the ankle. However, the centaur Cheiron helped Peleus once again, by replacing the <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">ankle bone</span> of Achilles with <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">one</span> belonging to the giant Damysos, a great runner. This was what gave Achilles his famous speed.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nAn oracle told Achilles that he was destined either to have a short yet glorious life, or a long and undistinguished one. Achilles chose the more noble course, and when the Trojan War began he joined the Greeks and turned out to be a tremendous fighter.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nHis most famous adventure, however, centres around an argument with his king, Agamemnon, during which he shunned the battle completely. Without his inspiring presence, the Greeks lost a great many men, and begged him to return. Achilles compromised — he would allow his best friend Patrocles to wear his armour, fooling the Trojans into thinking he was Achilles and losing heart.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nBut then the plan backfired, and Patrocles was killed. Achilles was so brokenhearted and upset that he rejoined the war, fighting more fiercely than ever and killing the best Trojan fighter, Hector. However, he was hated by Apollo, who was fighting with the Trojans in the great war, and who killed Achilles in battle by shooting an arrow at the only vulnerable part of his body — his heel.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>Internet: &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk&gt; (adapted).</em></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nJudge the following item, based on the text above.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nIn line 21, the word “one” refers to “ankle bone”.</p>",

Following in the path of Montreal, Paris, and Cardiff, London mayor Boris Johnson is to unveil the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme this Friday, and Londoners and visitors will have access to almost-free bike hire in 30-minute bursts. Over the past few weeks new docking stations have been appearing<br/>\nacross central London in readiness for the 6,000 bikes that will be available for rent. The scheme is modelled on the Bixi project that has become a big success in the Canadian city of Montreal, and even uses similar bikes. Once you’ve paid a £1 a day access charge, the first half an hour’s rental is free, and you can make as many 30-minute trips in the day as you like without paying a penny more.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">From this Friday, and for the first month, it will only be open to those who become members by registering online and agreeing to pay £3 for a smartcard. After that period the scheme will be opened to everyone. Once fully up and running, spontaneous users will be able to go to one of the capital’s 400 docking stations, enter their credit or debit card details, select a bike and ride off. When they have finished that journey, they deposit the bike at the nearest docking station. You can repeat this as many times as you like during the day – or in the period for which you have paid to access the bikes.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">Transport for London</span>, which is behind the scheme, <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">says it is aimed at those</span> in the capital who need to make short, repeated journeys, rather than longer rentals. Potential users need to be aware that if they return their bike after their access time has expired, they face a punitive £150 late return charge. If the bike goes missing, or is damaged by the hirer – or vandals – the hirer will have to pay up to £300 to cover the loss. Punctures are considered wear and tear.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\">Miles Brignall. London joins the bike rental revolution.<br/>\nIn: The Guardian.

Today, efforts to clean the smog are showing visible progress, revealing stunning views of snow-capped volcanoes — and offering a model for the developing world. International experts are praising the country’s progress. Many say its determined efforts to control auto emissions and other environmental effects of rapid urbanization offer practical lessons to cities in China, India and other fast-growing countries. Mexican officials have attacked the root causes of pollution that plagues many <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">large urban centers with spiraling growth</span>. <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">They plan to further reduce vehicle emissions</span>, which are the city’s greatest source of pollution. Pemex, the state oil monopoly, plans to build a US$9.3 billion plant to produce low-sulfur fuel. Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard is expanding the low-emissions Metrobus system, which has eliminated 80,000 tons of carbon monoxide annually since 2005. Officials plan to add hybrid buses. A suburban train system is to replace hundreds of thousands of vehicles.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The potential payoff for such efforts is now in sight: Mexico City does not even rank among the top 10 polluted cities worldwide. Mexico City appears to have cut most of its pollutants at least by half, while recent studies show a number of cities in China and India recording higher levels of the most serious pollutants. In 1992, the United Nations declared Mexico City the most polluted on the planet. High ozone levels were thought to cause 1,000 deaths and 35,000 hospitalizations a year. Mexico was forced to act. It replaced the city’s sootbelching old cars, removed lead from gasoline, embraced natural gas, expanded public transportation, and relocated refineries and factories. Change was gradual, but the pace has quickened in recent years. The presence of lead in the air has dropped by 90 percent since 1990. Suspended particles – pieces of dust, soot or chemicals that lodge in lungs and cause asthma, emphysema or cancer – have been cut by 70 percent. Carbon monoxide and other pollutants also have been drastically reduced.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><span style=\"\">Anne-Marie O’Connor.

Michael Housman, chief data science officer at RapportBoost.AI, explained that the ideal scenario for machine learning and artificial intelligence is something with fixed rules and a clear-cut measure of success or failure. He named chess as an obvious example. This happened faster than anyone anticipated because of the game’s very clear rules and limited set of moves. Housman elaborated, “Language is almost the opposite of that. There aren’t as clearly-cut and defined rules.”</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nI asked Dr. Jorge Majfud, Associate Professor of Spanish, at Jacksonville University, to explain why consistently accurate language translation has thus far eluded AI. He replied, “The problem is that considering the ‘entire’ sentence is still not enough.” He noted that <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">sarcasm</span> and irony only make sense within this widened context. Similarly, idioms can be problematic for automated translations.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\nDr. Majfud warned, “We should be aware of the fragility of their ‘interpretation.’ Because to translate is basically to interpret, not just an idea but a feeling. Human feelings and ideas that only humans can understand — and sometimes not even we, humans, understand other humans.” He noted that cultures, gender, and even age can pose barriers to this understanding and also contended that an over-reliance on technology is leading to our <span style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 156, 18);\">cultural</span> and political decline.

Below him there were fat antelope grazing. But this hunter couldn't be bothered, so lazy was he! He gazed at the herd, wishing that he could have the meat without the work, when suddenly he noticed a movement. It was a female cheetah. She singled out an antelope who had foolishly wandered away from the rest. With great speed she came upon the antelope and brought it down.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\tThe hunter watched as the cheetah dragged her prize to some shade on the edge of the clearing. There three beautiful cheetah cubs were waiting for her. The lazy hunter was filled with envy. Then he had a wicked idea. He decided that he would steal one of the cheetah cubs and train it to hunt for him.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\tWhen the sun began to set, the cheetah left her cubs concealed in a bush and set off to the waterhole. Quickly the hunter went to the bushes where the cubs were hidden. He first chose one, then decided upon another, and then changed his mind again. Finally, he stole them all.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\tWhen their mother returned half-an-hour later and found her babies gone, she was broken-hearted.

She cried so loudly that she was heard by an old man who came to see what the noise was all about.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\tThe old man returned to the village and told the elders what has happened.

They also maintain a period of abstinence or fasting. The day of “Divali” is marked with a host of activities in the homes where various dishes and sweets are prepared and “Pooja” is performed. Family members participate in evening worship at 6 o’clock to Mother Lakshmi, the Goddess of prosperity and wealth. They then light their homes with several dozens of “deyas” and distribute delicacies to their families, friends and the community.

This new key concept within the basket of global heritage conventions is, however, pre-structured by different patrimonial forerunners. If we want to understand the complex nature of today’s heritage, we have to take into account that the cultural life of heritage bureaucracies is shaped by national traditions devoted to the interpretation of history in general. One of these national traditions is the protection of historical monuments that also shaped the semantic field of heritage.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br/>\n\t\tOne of the central characteristics of UNESCO’s heritage operations is the fact that the member states choosing to ratify a given convention have to translate the internationally binding legal instruments into concrete national heritage policy. UNESCO’s program addressing natural and tangible heritage could build on existing legal frameworks at national levels; the implementation of the new concept of intangible heritage required that new frameworks be established. In this context, it is not only important to ask how an internationally negotiated concept such as intangible heritage is implemented on a national level, but also how this implementation is brought into being in bureaucratic ways. From a cultural anthropological perspective, it is methodologically relevant to pursue the path of this <span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">unfolding implementation</span> through concrete actors, taking in account what range of agency is allotted to them. Heritage interventions on international as well as national levels are realized by different institutional actors, such as ministries on a higher level and museums, for example, on a lower level; individual actors outside of or within different institutional settings may, depending on the political context, contribute as well.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><br/><span style=\"\"><em>M.

NSA-contractor Edward Snowden revealed from Hong Kong that he had handed over hundreds of thousands of documents to reporters, and said he was doing so to prevent the establishment of “turn-key tyranny” in America.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(231, 76, 60);\">The ensuing revelations and Snowden’s flight to Russia infuriated the Obama administration,</span> which sought his extradition on criminal charges.

The goal of this agreement is to increase the speed of patent registration. Since patent applications take an average of 8 years to be approved in Brazil, this agreement will hopefully aid in the goal of cutting that time in half by 2015. The president of INPI commented: “In practical terms, we will eliminate the need in one patent office to reexamine parts of patent applications that have been denied in the other patent office. That will reduce the workload in both offices by around 10% to 15%”.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Brazil has historically been at odds with the US and the multinational pharmaceutical industry on a variety of issues. Brazil has a national public health policy of promoting generic drug manufacturers and generally tends to be against “blockbuster” drugs, rallying for large pharmaceutical companies to bring down treatment costs.
